  Context Permutation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11754) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.11754))| Jeff Z. Pan, Mirella Lapata, pvougiou, hwy9855 | Language models (LMs) performance on multi-hop question answering (MHQA) is analyzed by varying the order of retrieved documents in the input context. The study investigates how encoder-decoder (Flan-T5) and decoder-only (Qwen, Llama) architectures respond to document permutations. The primary methodology involves evaluating LM accuracy on the MuSiQue dataset under different document orderings, distances, and completeness configurations. It was found that fine-tuned LMs favor forward-placed documents and bi-directional attention can improve performance. An attention weight analysis showed that LMs typically assign higher attention weights to relevant documents when answering correctly; specifically, accuracy of Qwen 7B was increased from 28.6% to 33.7% by sampling answers with different input document permutations and retaining answers for the inputs for which the LM assigned the largest peak attention score.

The research aims to address the lack of linguistic diversity in existing review helpfulness datasets by creating a large-scale Vietnamese dataset. The methodology involved a two-step annotation process using LLMs followed by human verification and refinement. The experiments demonstrate that human-verified annotations achieve higher quality, showing a Cohen's Kappa score of 31.34% for ground truth Helpfulness Score, indicating "Fair Agreement" compared to AI annotations. The principal implication for AI practitioners is the demonstrated need for human verification to ensure data quality in complex annotation tasks despite the advantages of LLMs in reducing costs and annotation time.  |

  Pretraining to Posttraining (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07608) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.07608))| whatseeker, Prestonprom, HugoZHL, dwzhu, xiabingquan | This paper introduces MiMo-7B, a large language model optimized across pre-training and post-training stages specifically for reasoning tasks. The primary objective is to unlock and enhance the inherent reasoning potential of language models by systematically improving data processing, model architecture, and reinforcement learning techniques. Key methodologies include a three-stage pre-training data mixing strategy on 25 trillion tokens with a Multi-Token Prediction objective, and post-training using reinforcement learning on 130K verifiable math/code problems with a novel test-difficulty-driven code-reward scheme and strategic data resampling. The final RL-tuned model, MiMo-7B-RL, achieves superior performance, notably scoring 55.4 on AIME 2025, surpassing OpenAI o1-mini by 4.7 points, and significantly outperforming it on LiveCodeBench v5 (MiMo-7B-RL: 57.8, o1-mini: 53.8). The principal implication for AI practitioners is that targeted optimizations in both pre-training and post-training, particularly with high-quality verifiable data and refined RL reward mechanisms, can enable smaller models to achieve state-of-the-art reasoning capabilities comparable to or exceeding much larger or proprietary models. |
| Step1X-3D: Towards High-Fidelity and Controllable Generation of Textured
  3D Assets (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07747) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.07747))| PanJianxiong, flybirdtian, shian7, wchengad, xuanyangz | Step1X-3D introduces an open framework for high-fidelity, controllable generation of textured 3D assets through rigorous data curation and a novel two-stage 3D-native architecture. The primary objective is to overcome fundamental challenges in 3D generation, such as data scarcity and algorithmic limitations, by providing an open and reproducible solution. Its methodology combines a pipeline curating over 5 million initial assets into a 2 million high-quality dataset, a hybrid VAE-DiT for Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF)-based geometry generation, and a diffusion model for geometrically-conditioned, view-consistent texture synthesis, notably supporting direct transfer of 2D control techniques like LoRA. Step1X-3D achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source methods, notably attaining the highest texture CLIP-Score of 0.853 in comparative benchmarks and competitive geometry scores (e.g., Uni3D-I of 0.361). For AI practitioners, this framework offers a robust, open-source baseline with models, training code, and curated data, facilitating advancements in controllable 3D asset generation and simplifying the integration of established 2D control mechanisms into 3D workflows. |
| Learning from Peers in Reasoning Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07787) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.07787))| Benyou, tangzhy, Jiaxi0775, wydu, Zeno-Luo | This paper introduces Learning from Peers (LeaP), a method for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) to overcome the "Prefix Dominance Trap"—where poor initial reasoning hinders recovery—by sharing intermediate insights among parallel inference paths. The primary objective is to enhance the limited self-correction capabilities of LRMs by enabling them to learn from diverse reasoning trajectories. LeaP's methodology involves periodic communication (every T tokens) where each reasoning path summarizes its current state, sharing these summaries with peers via a routing mechanism (e.g., Dispersed, Hybrid); a fine-tuned LeaP-T series is proposed for smaller models. Key results show significant improvements: QwQ-32B with LeaP achieves nearly 5 absolute points higher Pass@1 on average than its baseline, and on a 14B model, LeaP reduced the "Prefix Dominance Trap" performance gap from 19.88 to 7.81 points on an AIME 2024 subset. For AI practitioners, this research offers a strategy to build more robust reasoning systems by facilitating collaborative error correction and diverse exploration during inference, improving performance even when initial reasoning is flawed. |
| Unified Continuous Generative Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07447) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.07447))| Yi Jiang, tlin-taolin, sp12138sp | This paper introduces a unified framework, UCGM, for continuous generative models. The research aims to provide a unified training and sampling methodology applicable to both multi-step and few-step generative models. The proposed methodology uses a unified training objective parameterized by a consistency ratio and a novel self-boosting mechanism for improved performance. Experiments on ImageNet 256x256 using a 675M diffusion transformer model show UCGM-T achieves 1.30 FID in 20 sampling steps and 1.42 FID in 2 sampling steps. AI practitioners can leverage UCGM for improved training efficiency and sample quality across different continuous generative modeling paradigms, with reduced reliance on classifier-free guidance.  |
| REFINE-AF: A Task-Agnostic Framework to Align Language Models via
  Self-Generated Instructions using Reinforcement Learning from Automated
  Feedback (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06548) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.06548))| Pawan Goyal, Somak Aditya, Aniruddha Roy, abhi1nandy2, Pretam | REFINE-AF is a task-agnostic framework that aligns smaller open-source language models using self-generated instructions and Reinforcement Learning from Automated Feedback (RLAF). The primary objective is to investigate the effectiveness of smaller LLMs (LLaMA 2-7B/13B, Mistral 7B) for task-agnostic instruction generation and assess the impact of RLAF in this process. The methodology involves a three-stage pipeline: iterative instruction generation from a seed set, RLAF using a reward model (based on `oasst-rm-pythia-1.4b` and UniEval metrics) with PPO to refine input-output pair generation, followed by supervised fine-tuning on the resultant dataset. REFINE-AF demonstrated superior performance over the SELF INSTRUCT baseline on the SUPER-NI benchmark, with the LLaMA 2 13B model achieving a 6.6133 average ROUGE-L score and outperforming in 66.39% of tasks using 15,000 generated instructions. For AI practitioners, this research offers a cost-effective method to generate diverse, high-quality instruction datasets for fine-tuning smaller, open-source LLMs, thereby enhancing their instruction-following capabilities with reduced human effort. |
| DanceGRPO: Unleashing GRPO on Visual Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07818) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.07818))| appleluo, ChenMnZ, ltzhu, wujie10, xzyhku | This paper introduces DanceGRPO, a unified framework adapting Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance visual generation across diverse generative paradigms, tasks, and models. The research aims to overcome limitations in existing RL-based visual generation, such as incompatibility with ODE-based sampling and training instability, by developing a versatile RL framework for aligning models with human preferences. DanceGRPO reformulates sampling for diffusion and rectified flow models as Markov Decision Processes, unifies them using Stochastic Differential Equations, and applies a GRPO objective with strategies for noise initialization, timestep selection, and multi-reward aggregation. DanceGRPO achieves substantial improvements, outperforming baselines by up to 181% on benchmarks like VideoAlign (e.g., a 181% relative improvement in motion quality for HunyuanVideo) and demonstrating robust performance across various models and tasks. DanceGRPO provides AI practitioners with a scalable and effective Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) solution for aligning complex visual generative models across image and video domains, enabling more stable and higher-quality visual synthesis. |
| AttentionInfluence: Adopting Attention Head Influence for Weak-to-Strong
  Pretraining Data Selection (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07293) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.07293))| Steven Wu, Kai Hua, shenke18, zhangysk | This paper introduces AttentionInfluence, a training-free method that uses attention head masking in a small pretrained language model to select high-quality, reasoning-intensive pretraining data for improving larger LLMs. The main objective is to develop an efficient, scalable, and unsupervised method for identifying diverse, high-quality pretraining data to enhance complex reasoning in LLMs, without relying on labeled data or supervised classifiers. AttentionInfluence identifies "retrieval heads" in a small pretrained language model (e.g., 1.3B parameters) using a synthetic task, then computes a data quality score based on the relative loss difference when these heads are masked versus unmasked; this score is used to rank and select data from a large corpus. Using data selected by a 1.3B model, a 7B pretrained model demonstrated substantial improvements, such as a +3.5pp increase on the HumanEval benchmark and +2.7pp on GSM8K, compared to a baseline trained on the unselected corpus. This method offers AI practitioners a scalable, computationally cheaper, and training-free alternative for curating reasoning-centric pretraining datasets, enabling smaller models to effectively guide data selection for training more capable larger models, thus demonstrating weak-to-strong generalization. |
| WebGen-Bench: Evaluating LLMs on Generating Interactive and Functional
  Websites from Scratch (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03733) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.03733))| shiwk20, hht1113, Houxing, Yqy6, luzimu | This paper introduces WebGen-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate LLM-based agents on generating multi-file interactive websites from scratch. The primary objective is to systematically assess and improve LLM agents' ability to create functional and aesthetically pleasing websites based on natural language instructions. The methodology involves curating diverse website generation instructions (human + GPT-4o), creating 647 test cases (GPT-4o + manual refinement), and employing an automated pipeline with a web-navigation agent (WebVoyager) for functional testing and GPT-4o for aesthetic scoring. The best general-purpose agent combination (Bolt.diy with DeepSeek-R1) achieved only 27.8% accuracy, while fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct on a subset of their WebGen-Instruct dataset (creating WebGen-LM-32B) reached 38.2% accuracy. For AI practitioners, this work highlights the current limitations of LLMs in complex, from-scratch code generation tasks like website creation but demonstrates that targeted fine-tuning with specialized instructional datasets can significantly enhance these capabilities. |
| Learning Dynamics in Continual Pre-Training for Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07796) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.07796))| Daniel Dajun Zeng, Lu Wang, Xingjin Wang, linjinglian, Howe77 | This paper introduces a CPT scaling law that models learning dynamics in continually pre-trained large language models by decoupling the effects of distribution shift and learning rate annealing to predict validation loss. The primary objective is to quantitatively describe and predict how general (Dpt) and specific-domain (Dcpt) validation losses evolve throughout the CPT process under various training configurations. The methodology involves deriving the scaling law by combining a base pre-training loss component (L_base, affected by summed learning rate S1 and annealing area S2) with a distribution shift component (ΔL, modeled as a power-law function of CPT summed LR S1_cpt), fitting parameters using Huber loss minimization. Key results demonstrate that this CPT scaling law (L(t) = Lo + A*(S1_pt + S1_cpt)^-α - C1*S2_pt - C2*S2_cpt + B*(1 - (1 + E*S1_cpt)^-β)) accurately fits validation loss curves across different learning rate schedules, datasets, model sizes, and replay ratios, with the distribution shift term fitting achieving R² values like 0.994 (Dpt) and 0.985 (Dcpt) initially. For AI practitioners, this scaling law provides a predictive tool to optimize CPT hyperparameters—such as loss potential, peak LR, and replay ratio—to effectively balance general and domain-specific performance (Finding 5) and can guide the adaptation of open-source models with unknown pre-training details. |
| Skywork-VL Reward: An Effective Reward Model for Multimodal
  Understanding and Reasoning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07263) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.07263))| Yi Peng, Wei Shen, Jiangbo Pei, OrlandoHugBot, shawn0wang | The paper introduces Skywork-VL Reward, a novel multimodal reward model designed for robust evaluation of multimodal understanding and reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Its primary objective is to provide reliable reward signals for aligning diverse VLMs, including advanced reasoners, with human preferences across a wide range of tasks. The methodology involves curating a large-scale preference dataset of approximately 190,000 pairs and fine-tuning a Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct base model with an added reward head using a multi-stage, pairwise ranking loss approach. Skywork-VL Reward achieves state-of-the-art 73.1% overall accuracy on the VL-RewardBench, and its preference data, when used for Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO), improved a VLM's MathVista score from 69.2% to 73.5%. For AI practitioners, Skywork-VL Reward offers an effective open-source tool for VLM alignment, and its utility in generating high-quality preference data can significantly boost the reasoning capabilities of downstream VLMs. |
| Reinforced Internal-External Knowledge Synergistic Reasoning for
  Efficient Adaptive Search Agent (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07596) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.07596))| Kang Liu, Jun Zhao, Yiming Ju, Xiaowei Yuan, hzy | This paper introduces IKEA, a reinforcement learning-based agent that synergistically reasons with internal and external knowledge for efficient adaptive search by discerning its own knowledge boundaries. The primary objective is to develop an efficient adaptive search agent that can determine when to use its internal parametric knowledge versus external retrieved knowledge, thereby reducing redundant retrievals and improving reasoning accuracy. IKEA employs reinforcement learning with a novel knowledge-boundary aware reward function and a specially constructed training dataset (balanced between internally-known and externally-required questions) to learn optimal retrieval timing. Evaluations demonstrate that IKEA significantly outperforms baselines; for instance, on Qwen2.5-7B, IKEA achieved an average Exact Match (EM) of 50.05% while reducing retrieval frequency by 50.81% (to 0.91 retrievals) compared to the Search-R1 baseline (45.00% EM, 1.85 retrievals). AI practitioners can leverage IKEA's approach of knowledge-boundary aware rewards and dataset construction to train more efficient and accurate retrieval-augmented LLM agents that better utilize internal knowledge, leading to reduced latency and computational cost in knowledge-intensive tasks. |
| H^{3}DP: Triply-Hierarchical Diffusion Policy for Visuomotor
  Learning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07819) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.07819))| Pu Hua, Zhecheng Yuan, Yufeng Tian, binaryXwizard, Lyy0725 | H³DP introduces a triply-hierarchical diffusion policy for visuomotor learning that integrates depth-aware input, multi-scale visual features, and hierarchical action generation to improve robotic manipulation. The primary objective is to enhance visuomotor policy learning by explicitly incorporating hierarchical structures across visual perception and action generation, thereby strengthening their coupling for improved performance in complex robotic manipulation tasks. The H³DP framework employs three hierarchical levels: 1) depth-aware input layering of RGB-D observations based on depth information, 2) multi-scale visual representations encoding semantic features at varying granularities, and 3) a hierarchically conditioned diffusion process where coarse-to-fine action generation is guided by corresponding visual features at different scales. H³DP achieved a +27.5% average relative improvement over baselines across 44 simulation tasks (resulting in a 75.6% average success rate for H³DP) and demonstrated superior performance in 4 challenging bimanual real-world manipulation tasks, with specific results like a 66.2% average success rate on instance generalization tasks. AI practitioners can leverage the triply-hierarchical design of H³DP to develop more robust and effective visuomotor learning agents, as explicitly structuring the perception-action pipeline with depth awareness, multi-scale feature encoding, and hierarchical action conditioning significantly enhances policy performance and generalization in complex, cluttered environments. |
| Continuous Visual Autoregressive Generation via Score Maximization (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07812) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.07812))| Jie Zhou, Fandong Meng, cccczshao | This paper introduces a Continuous Visual Autoregressive (VAR) framework enabling direct visual generation without vector quantization by optimizing strictly proper scoring rules. The main objective is to overcome information loss from quantization in traditional VAR models by developing a method for direct autoregressive generation in continuous visual data spaces. The key methodology involves using strictly proper scoring rules, primarily the energy score, as training objectives within a Transformer architecture (termed Energy-based AutoRegression or EAR), where an MLP generator implicitly models the predictive distribution. The EAR-H model achieves a Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) of 1.97 on ImageNet 256x256 conditional generation, demonstrating competitive performance with significantly higher inference efficiency compared to per-token diffusion methods. The principal implication for AI practitioners is the provision of a likelihood-free training paradigm for autoregressive models on continuous data, offering an alternative to quantization-based approaches and potentially leading to improved generation quality and efficiency for modalities beyond discrete tokens. |
| Overflow Prevention Enhances Long-Context Recurrent LLMs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07793) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.07793))| rgiryes, leokarlin, OmegaLittleBob, ItamarZ, assafbk | This paper introduces OPRM, a training-free chunk-based inference strategy that significantly enhances the long-context processing capabilities of recurrent LLMs by preventing memory overflows. The research investigates the limitations of fixed-size recurrent memory in large long-context models and aims to develop a method to mitigate these limitations, thereby improving their performance on long-context tasks. The proposed OPRM method involves segmenting the input context into fixed-size chunks, processing each chunk (wrapped with original prefix and suffix) speculatively in parallel, and then selectively decoding from the chunk determined to be most relevant, typically using a minimum entropy criterion combined with an IDK filter. Primary results demonstrate substantial improvements; for instance, on LongBench, OPRM improved the overall performance of RWKV6-Finch-7B by 51%, and Falcon3-Mamba-Inst-7B with OPRM achieved a state-of-the-art 30.8 score on the LongBench v2 benchmark for its size class. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that OPRM can be applied as an inference-time technique to existing recurrent LLMs to extend their effective context length and boost performance on tasks with very long sequences without retraining, making these models more competitive for long-context applications. |
| UMoE: Unifying Attention and FFN with Shared Experts (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07260) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.07260))| Jing Li, Chaozheng Wang, ysngkil | i) 1-line summary: This paper introduces UMoE, a unified Mixture-of-Experts architecture that reformulates attention to share FFN-like experts between attention and feed-forward network layers, improving performance and parameter efficiency.  ii) Main research question or objective: The primary objective was to determine if attention mechanisms can be reformulated to be compatible with FFN expert designs for unified MoE application and parameter sharing, without sacrificing expressive power.  iii) Key methodology used: UMoE employs a "pre-mixing" attention reformulation where input token embeddings are first aggregated via weighted summation before being processed by shared two-layer FFN experts, with expert-dependent query projections utilizing low-rank matrices.  iv) Primary results (include at least one specific quantitative finding): UMoE achieved superior performance, with its 540M parameter model attaining a perplexity of 20.44 on FineWeb-Edu, surpassing a comparable 535M FFN-MoE (PPL 21.19), and also demonstrated stronger average zero-shot accuracy (e.g., 40.06% for the base UMoE vs. 39.55% for FFN-MoE).  v) Principal implication for AI practitioners: AI practitioners can leverage UMoE to develop more parameter-efficient and higher-performing large language models by sharing expert modules across attention and FFN layers, informed by the paper's finding that FFN layers can be conceptualized as specialized attention layers with an identity matrix for token mixing. |
| Document Attribution: Examining Citation Relationships using Large
  Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06324) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.06324))| Nedim Lipka, Vipula Rawte, Franck-Dernoncourt, ryanrossi | This research investigates document attribution in LLMs by proposing a zero-shot textual entailment approach and an attention-based classification technique to verify citation reliability. The primary objective is to enhance the trustworthiness and interpretability of LLM-generated content by developing methods to accurately trace outputs to source documents and assess the reliability of these citations. The study employs a zero-shot textual entailment framework, prompting LLMs (specifically flan-ul2 and gpt4-o) to determine if a reference entails a claim, and explores an attention-based binary classification method using attention weights from a smaller LLM (flan-t5-small). The zero-shot textual entailment method using flan-ul2 achieved an F1 score of 73.8 on the in-distribution (ID) average and 83.43 on the out-of-distribution (OOD) average of AttributionBench, outperforming prior baselines (e.g., ID LFQA F1 of 85.38 vs. 80.1 baseline), while the preliminary attention-based method with flan-t5-small showed F1 score improvements over its zero-shot baseline on the LFQA subset for most layers. AI practitioners can leverage the proposed zero-shot textual entailment prompting strategy with models like flan-ul2 as a computationally efficient method to improve citation verification and attribution in document-based LLM applications, enhancing system reliability without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. |
| Physics-Assisted and Topology-Informed Deep Learning for Weather
  Prediction (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04918) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.04918))| Yerong Feng, Qing Ling, Yumenomae | PASSAT is a novel deep learning model for weather prediction that integrates physics, via the advection and Navier-Stokes equations, with a topology-informed spherical graph neural network to model weather evolution on a spherical manifold. The main objective is to develop a deep learning model that overcomes limitations of existing approaches by explicitly incorporating underlying physical laws and the Earth's spherical topology. PASSAT's methodology involves numerically solving the advection and Navier-Stokes equations on a spherical manifold for the advection process, while a spherical graph neural network estimates the Earth-atmosphere interaction and generates the initial velocity fields for the advection equation. On the 5.625°-resolution ERA5 dataset, PASSAT outperformed state-of-the-art deep learning models and the operational numerical weather prediction model IFS T42; for instance, for geopotential at 500hPa (z500) with a 72-hour lead time, PASSAT achieved an RMSE of 420, compared to 438 for GraphCast and 489 for IFS T42. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that synergistically combining deep learning with domain-specific physical differential equations and appropriate geometric representations can significantly improve model accuracy and physical consistency in complex spatio-temporal forecasting tasks. |
| Multi-Objective-Guided Discrete Flow Matching for Controllable
  Biological Sequence Design (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07086) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.07086))| Tong Chen, pranamanam, sophtang, yinuozhang | This paper introduces Multi-Objective-Guided Discrete Flow Matching (MOG-DFM), a framework for steering discrete flow matching models to design biological sequences optimizing multiple conflicting objectives. The research aims to develop a controllable method for generating Pareto-efficient peptide and DNA sequences by guiding pretrained discrete flow matching models across multiple functional and biophysical criteria. MOG-DFM iteratively guides a base discrete flow matching generator by computing a hybrid rank-directional score for candidate token transitions and applying an adaptive hypercone filter to ensure consistent multi-objective progression towards a specified trade-off. MOG-DFM significantly outperformed traditional multi-objective algorithms in peptide design, boosting non-fouling and solubility by approximately 30-50% and extending half-life by a factor of 3 to 4 compared to the next-best method. In DNA enhancer design, MOG-DFM successfully guided generation towards specific enhancer classes (e.g., achieving class 1 probability ~0.7) and desired DNA shapes (e.g., HelT ~36.0). AI engineers can leverage MOG-DFM as a versatile tool for de novo multi-property design of discrete biological sequences, enabling fine-grained control over trade-offs between complex, user-defined objectives. |

The main objective was to demonstrate that smaller, well-optimized models can achieve performance comparable to much larger counterparts for a less-resourced language using substantially fewer computational resources. Key methodologies included depth up-scaling Qwen2.5 base models, implementing a custom Polish tokenizer (APT4) for improved token efficiency, utilizing Adaptive Learning Rate, and training on a curated 292 billion token Polish-centric corpus. The primary result shows the 4.5B parameter Bielik v3 Instruct model achieved a competitive score of 56.13 on the Open PL LLM Leaderboard (5-shot), outperforming several models 2-3 times its size. For AI practitioners, this work implies that targeted optimization, including custom tokenization and architecture scaling techniques, allows for the development of high-performing, resource-efficient models for specific languages, potentially reducing computational costs for deployment. |
| Bielik 11B v2 Technical Report (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02410) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02410))| Adrian Gwoździej, Łukasz Flis, Remek, djstrong, chrisociepa | This report details Bielik 11B v2, an 11-billion parameter language model optimized for Polish, derived from Mistral 7B v0.2 using depth up-scaling and novel training methods. The primary objective was to create a state-of-the-art, computationally efficient model for Polish text processing with strong cross-lingual transferability. Methodology involved continued pre-training on a 198 billion token Polish-centric corpus, followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning and DPO-Positive alignment using custom techniques like Weighted Instruction Cross-Entropy Loss and Adaptive Learning Rate. Bielik-11B-v2 models achieve leading performance on Polish benchmarks, with v2.3-Instruct scoring 65.71 on the Open PL LLM Leaderboard, significantly outperforming its 7B predecessor and many larger models, while demonstrating robustness to quantization down to IQ2_XXS (61.34 score). For AI practitioners, Bielik 11B v2 offers a parameter-efficient (11B) model for high-quality Polish language tasks, deployable on constrained hardware due to effective quantization, serving as a benchmark for less-resourced language model development. |
| Healthy LLMs? Benchmarking LLM Knowledge of UK Government Public Health
  Information (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06046) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.06046))| Toby Nonnenmacher, Timothy Laurence, Felix Feldman, Fan Grayson, Joshua-Harris | This paper introduces PubHealthBench to benchmark Large Language Model (LLM) knowledge of UK Government public health information. The primary objective was to assess the accuracy and potential risks of using LLMs for retrieving public health guidance. An automated pipeline generated over 8000 Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) questions and a free-form response set from government documents, which were used to evaluate 24 LLMs. Key results show the best private LLMs achieve >90% accuracy in MCQA, significantly outperforming a human baseline using search engines, but no model scored above 75% in the more challenging free-form setting. For AI practitioners, this indicates that while SOTA LLMs possess strong factual recall for public health information in structured formats, deploying them for free-form response generation requires caution and potentially additional safeguards due to lower observed accuracy and hallucination risks. |
| UniVLA: Learning to Act Anywhere with Task-centric Latent Actions (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06111) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.06111))| Shenyuan Gao, Jisong Cai, Yanting Yang, Qingwen Bu, sundrops | UniVLA introduces a generalist vision-language-action framework enabling policy learning across diverse embodiments by deriving task-centric latent actions unsupervisedly from videos. The primary objective is to learn a unified, transferable action representation from heterogeneous video data (robot/human, varied perspectives) without requiring ground-truth action labels, addressing scalability limitations of current VLA models. Key methodology involves a two-stage latent action learning process using inverse dynamics on DINOv2 features conditioned by language to decouple task-centric actions, followed by pretraining an auto-regressive VLM on these latent actions and deploying with lightweight action decoders. UniVLA achieves state-of-the-art results, including a 95.2% average success rate on the LIBERO benchmark, significantly outperforming prior methods like OpenVLA (+18.5%) with substantially less pretraining compute (<1/20). For AI practitioners, this work presents a scalable and efficient method to train generalist robot policies by leveraging readily available, unlabeled video data, reducing dependence on annotated datasets and extensive computation. |
| G-FOCUS: Towards a Robust Method for Assessing UI Design Persuasiveness (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05026) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.05026))| Yejin Choi, Sumin Shim, Min Soo Kim, Jang Han Yoon, jeochris | This paper introduces WISERUI-BENCH for pairwise UI persuasiveness evaluation and G-FOCUS, a VLM reasoning strategy to improve assessment accuracy and reduce bias. The research aims to quantitatively evaluate and enhance VLM capabilities for assessing UI design persuasiveness, addressing the cost limitations of A/B testing and inherent VLM biases. Key methodology involves the WISERUI-BENCH dataset (300 UI pairs with A/B results and rationales) and the G-FOCUS inference strategy (goal extraction, difference localization, contrastive reasoning, evaluation). Results demonstrate G-FOCUS surpasses baselines in reliability; using GPT-4o, it achieved 43.33% Consistent Accuracy, a +12.66% improvement over the prior best baseline, indicating reduced bias. For AI practitioners, G-FOCUS offers a more robust automated method for comparative UI evaluation that can complement A/B testing and provide scalable preference data for aligning models towards human-preferred UI generation. |
| Sailing AI by the Stars: A Survey of Learning from Rewards in
  Post-Training and Test-Time Scaling of Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02686) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02686))| Xiaobao Wu | This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the "Learning from Rewards" paradigm used in post-training and test-time scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs). The main objective is to categorize and analyze the diverse strategies under this paradigm, detailing how reward signals guide LLM behavior across training, inference, and post-inference stages. Methodologically, the paper presents a unified conceptual framework and taxonomy, organizing techniques based on reward sources, reward model design dimensions (architecture, format, pattern, granularity), learning timing, and learning strategies (training-based/free). Key surveyed results include the successful application of techniques like RLHF and DPO for preference alignment, and the emergence of deep reasoning capabilities through methods like GRPO with rule-based rewards, as demonstrated by models like DeepSeek-R1 acquiring long Chain-of-Thoughts abilities. For AI practitioners, this survey offers a structured understanding for selecting and implementing appropriate reward-based methods to align, enhance, and scale LLMs beyond pre-training for specific tasks and desired behaviors. |
| A Preliminary Study for GPT-4o on Image Restoration (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05621) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.05621))| Liyuan Pan, Ruikun Zhang, Yan Yang, Hao Yang | This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of OpenAI's GPT-4o for diverse image restoration tasks. The primary objective is to investigate GPT-4o's capabilities and limitations in restoring degraded images across various domains like dehazing, deraining, and low-light enhancement. Methodology involves quantitative analysis using PSNR and CLIP-IQA metrics across eight tasks, qualitative assessment, failure case analysis, and proposing a baseline post-processing network using GPT-4o outputs as visual priors. Results show GPT-4o generates visually appealing outputs (high CLIP-IQA) but suffers poor pixel-level fidelity (e.g., PSNR often lower than degraded input, 12.89 dB vs. 21.58 dB in one example); however, using its outputs as priors significantly boosted a baseline network's performance (e.g., O-Haze PSNR improved from 20.86 to 22.08). For AI practitioners, the key implication is that GPT-4o outputs, despite structural inaccuracies, can serve as effective visual priors when integrated into pipelines with lightweight networks to enhance existing image restoration methods' perceptual quality and structural fidelity. |

| On Path to Multimodal Generalist: General-Level and General-Bench (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04620) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.04620))| Gh0stAR, ChocoWu, LXT, JunchengLi, scofield7419 | This paper introduces General-Level, a 5-level taxonomy, and General-Bench, a massive benchmark, to evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) based on their synergistic capabilities across comprehension, generation, and modalities. The research aims to establish a sophisticated evaluation framework that assesses MLLMs not just on task performance but on their "synergy effect"—the ability for knowledge in one modality/task to enhance others—as a truer measure of generalist intelligence towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The General-Level framework classifies MLLMs into five levels, with progression requiring increasing synergy, defined by outperforming State-of-the-Art (SoTA) specialists on tasks within the General-Bench, which comprises over 700 tasks and 325,800 instances across image, video, audio, 3D, and language. Evaluation of over 100 MLLMs on General-Bench revealed that most lack the cross-task or cross-modal synergy for higher General-Level classifications; for instance, only 3 models (Mini-Gemini, Emu2-37B, Vitron-V1) achieved Level 4, with Mini-Gemini scoring 1.56, and no model reached Level 5 (total synergy). AI practitioners can use General-Level and General-Bench to rigorously assess and compare MLLM synergistic abilities, providing a roadmap for developing more robust generalists that can better integrate and transfer knowledge across diverse multimodal inputs and tasks, a critical step towards AGI. |
| Perception, Reason, Think, and Plan: A Survey on Large Multimodal
  Reasoning Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04921) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.04921))| imryanxu, xyidealist, TerenceL-TL, foggyforest, YunxinLi | This survey details the evolution of Large Multimodal Reasoning Models (LMRMs) across four developmental stages, identifies current limitations, and proposes a future direction towards Native LMRMs (N-LMRMs) capable of integrated omni-modal perception, agentic reasoning, and generative capabilities. The paper aims to provide a comprehensive, structured review of multimodal reasoning research, analyze the entire roadmap from early modular designs to state-of-the-art LMRMs, and project future developments for next-generation systems. The research employs a survey methodology, synthesizing over 540 publications to delineate a four-stage developmental roadmap (Perception-Driven Modular, Language-Centric Short, Language-Centric Long, and prospective Native LMRMs), supported by analysis of existing models, benchmarks, and experimental insights from models like OpenAI's O3 and O4-mini. Current LMRMs, while advancing, show significant limitations in omni-modal generalization and agentic behavior; for instance, on the OmniMMI benchmark, even commercial models like Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o achieve less than 20% average accuracy, and performance drops further on tasks requiring unified understanding across multiple modalities. AI practitioners should focus on developing N-LMRMs with unified architectures for heterogeneous modalities, interleaved multimodal reasoning, and continuous learning from interaction, as current language-centric LMRMs are insufficient for complex, real-world omni-modal and agentic tasks. |
| Flow-GRPO: Training Flow Matching Models via Online RL (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05470) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.05470))| dizhang, Xintao, CheeryLJH, Lp256, liuhuohuo | Flow-GRPO introduces online reinforcement learning (RL) to flow matching models by converting deterministic Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to equivalent Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) for stochastic exploration and employing a Denoising Reduction strategy for efficient training. The main objective is to effectively integrate online RL, specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), with flow matching generative models to enhance their capabilities in complex text-to-image (T2I) tasks, such as compositional understanding and text rendering, while maintaining image quality and sampling efficiency. The key methodology involves two strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms the model's deterministic generative process into a stochastic one, matching the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps to enable statistical sampling for RL exploration, and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces the number of denoising steps during RL training (e.g., 10 steps) compared to inference (e.g., 40 steps) to improve sampling efficiency. Flow-GRPO demonstrated significant improvements across multiple T2I tasks; notably, for complex compositions, the RL-tuned SD3.5-Medium model increased GenEval accuracy from 63% to 95%, while visual text rendering accuracy improved from 59% to 92%, with little to no reward hacking observed. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that online RL can be effectively applied to state-of-the-art flow matching models to enhance specific generation capabilities and align with human preferences by introducing stochasticity via SDE conversion and accelerating training through denoising reduction, with Kullback-Leibler (KL) constraints proving vital for preventing performance degradation in general image quality. |
| Sentient Agent as a Judge: Evaluating Higher-Order Social Cognition in
  Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02847) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02847))| Peisong Wang, Qingxuan Jiang, Bang Zhang, zptu, vvibt | This paper introduces Sentient Agent as a Judge (SAGE), an automated framework using an LLM-powered agent to evaluate higher-order social cognition in large language models by simulating human-like emotional responses and inner thoughts. The primary objective is to develop a robust method for assessing LLMs' abilities to understand and respond to human emotions and intentions in multi-turn dialogues, moving beyond mere textual competence. SAGE employs a "Sentient Agent," instantiated with a persona, background, goals, and hidden intentions, which interacts with the LLM being tested; this agent uses multi-hop reasoning to simulate emotional changes (quantified as an emotion score trajectory) and generate contextually appropriate responses. The Sentient emotion score from SAGE shows strong correlation with human-centric psychological metrics like the Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory (BLRI) (Pearson r = 0.818) and utterance-level empathy (Pearson r = 0.788), and its leaderboard reveals GPT-40-Latest achieved the top Sentient score of 79.9. For AI practitioners, SAGE offers a principled and scalable tool to benchmark progress towards genuinely empathetic LLMs, with findings like GPT-40-Latest achieving a top Sentient score (79.9) with high token efficiency (3.3K tokens), indicating an advance in socially adept AI development. |
| Scalable Chain of Thoughts via Elastic Reasoning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05315) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.05315))| cxiong, JunnanLi, doyensahoo, hendrydong, yuhuixu | The paper introduces Elastic Reasoning, a framework for large reasoning models to produce scalable chain-of-thought outputs under strict inference budgets by separating reasoning into 'thinking' and 'solution' phases with independent budgets and training via budget-constrained rollouts. Its main objective is to enable robust and efficient reasoning from these models when faced with limited computational resources at inference time. The core methodology combines separate budgeting for thinking and solution generation at inference with a GRPO-based training strategy that simulates budget exhaustion, teaching the model to adapt to incomplete reasoning. Key results demonstrate that an E1-Math-1.5B model, trained with significantly fewer steps (200 vs. 700-820 for baselines), achieves 35.0% accuracy on AIME2024 with a 2K token budget, outperforming baselines, and reduces token usage by 32.1% in unconstrained settings compared to the original model while maintaining comparable performance. For AI practitioners, Elastic Reasoning offers a practical approach to deploy advanced reasoning models in resource-constrained environments by providing fine-grained control over inference costs without substantial performance loss or extensive retraining overhead. |
| FG-CLIP: Fine-Grained Visual and Textual Alignment (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05071) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.05071))| DaweiLiang, jinchenglijc, fanjing, binwang, xiechunyu | FG-CLIP is a model that significantly enhances fine-grained visual and textual understanding in multimodal systems. The primary objective was to address the limitations of existing CLIP-like models in comprehending detailed visual attributes and relationships, which often struggle due to coarse-grained input and a lack of region-specific alignment. FG-CLIP's methodology involves three key innovations: generating 1.6 billion long caption-image pairs for global semantic detail, constructing a dataset of 12 million images with 40 million region-specific bounding boxes aligned with detailed captions, and incorporating 10 million hard fine-grained negative samples, all trained using a two-stage process with an extended text encoder capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate FG-CLIP's superiority; for instance, FG-CLIP (ViT-L/14) achieved 48.4% accuracy on the fine-grained understanding benchmark FG-OVD (hard subset), substantially outperforming the original CLIP's 15.4%. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that leveraging large-scale, meticulously curated datasets with detailed long captions, region-level annotations, and challenging negative samples is crucial for advancing the nuanced understanding and discriminative power of multimodal models, particularly for tasks requiring fine-grained distinctions. |
| 3D Scene Generation: A Survey (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05474) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.05474))| Fangzhou Hong, liuziwei7, FrozenBurning, hzxie, wenbc21 | This survey systematically reviews and categorizes state-of-the-art 3D scene generation techniques, analyzing their foundations, trade-offs, datasets, and applications. The paper's objective is to provide a comprehensive overview of 3D scene generation, organizing existing approaches and identifying current challenges and future research directions at the intersection of generative AI, 3D vision, and embodied intelligence. The authors surveyed and classified existing methods into four main paradigms—procedural generation, neural 3D-based generation, image-based generation, and video-based generation—analyzing their technical foundations, trade-offs, and representative results, along with datasets and evaluation protocols. The survey highlights a significant growth in the field, particularly noting that in 2024, neural 3D-based generation and video-based generation methods saw 93 and 61 publications respectively (Figure 1, with 2025 data being partial up to April 30th). For AI practitioners, this work offers a structured guide to current 3D scene generation methods, their comparative strengths (summarized in Table 1), common datasets (Table 3), and evaluation protocols, facilitating informed decision-making for developing applications in areas such as immersive media, robotics, and autonomous driving. |
| ICon: In-Context Contribution for Automatic Data Selection (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05327) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.05327))| Zhifang Sui, soliz1998, yaolily, Rsy24, yyxsghx | The paper introduces ICON, a gradient-free method leveraging in-context learning (ICL) to automatically select high-contribution data for LLM instruction tuning, enhancing performance while reducing computational costs. The primary objective is to develop an efficient automated data selection method for instruction tuning that measures individual sample contribution without costly gradient computations or manually designed heuristics. ICON quantifies sample contribution by assessing performance shifts (via perplexity changes) on a diverse assessment set when a candidate sample is included in an ICL prompt, then uses these "ICON scores" to train a lightweight LoRA-based selection model. On LLaMA3.1-8B, training on 15% of ICON-selected Alpaca data outperformed full dataset training by 5.42 percentage points on average across 12 benchmarks and surpassed the best prior selection methods by 2.06 percentage points. AI practitioners can use ICON for more efficient and effective instruction tuning dataset curation, as it demonstrates that smaller, carefully selected subsets comprising diverse and appropriately difficult samples can yield superior model performance with significantly reduced computational overhead. |
| LiftFeat: 3D Geometry-Aware Local Feature Matching (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03422) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.03422))| Jinchi Zhu, Yuxuan Xiong, Zhou Zhao, Wenpeng Lai, pengliu123 | i) The paper introduces LiftFeat, a lightweight network integrating 3D geometric features to enhance 2D local feature matching robustness. ii) The main objective is to improve the discriminative ability of 2D feature descriptors under extreme conditions by incorporating 3D geometric information. iii) The methodology involves extracting 3D geometric features supervised by pseudo surface normal labels derived from monocular depth estimation and fusing these with 2D descriptors using a 3D Geometry-aware Feature Lifting module. iv) Experimental results show LiftFeat outperforms other lightweight methods on relative pose estimation, homography estimation, and visual localization, and runtime tests confirm that the method can achieve inference latency of 7.4 ms on edge devices. v) LiftFeat offers AI practitioners a computationally efficient method for enhancing feature matching in challenging scenarios by leveraging readily available 3D geometric context, which is helpful to integrate into robotic applications.  |
| X-Reasoner: Towards Generalizable Reasoning Across Modalities and
  Domains (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03981) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.03981))| RustyArchimedes, sidkiblawi, hiaoxui, shengz, qianchu | This paper introduces X-REASONER, a vision-language model that achieves strong generalizable reasoning across modalities and domains through post-training solely on general-domain text. The research investigates whether reasoning capabilities can be effectively generalized across different input modalities and specialized domains using only general-domain text-based post-training. X-REASONER employs a two-stage post-training process: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on general-domain text with distilled long chain-of-thoughts, followed by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) using mathematical text. Despite text-only training, X-REASONER surpasses prior 7B models trained with multimodal data on benchmarks like MMMU (Val) (56.4% vs. 55.0% SOTA) and MMMU-Pro (43.0% vs. 40.7% SOTA), while its medical-specialized variant, X-REASONER-MED, achieves new SOTA on medical tasks. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that carefully designed text-only post-training can be a highly data-efficient strategy to imbue models with robust, transferable reasoning skills, potentially reducing reliance on expensive multimodal or in-domain datasets. |
| Generating Physically Stable and Buildable LEGO Designs from Text (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05469) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.05469))| junyanz, devakramanan, RLCMU, kangled, AvaLovelace | i) The paper introduces LEGOGPT, an autoregressive model for generating physically stable and buildable LEGO designs from text prompts. ii) The primary objective is to generate LEGO brick models from text while ensuring physical stability and buildability. iii) The methodology involves constructing a dataset of LEGO designs with associated captions and training an autoregressive large language model to predict the next brick via next-token prediction, incorporating physics-aware constraints during training and inference. iv) The method achieves 98.8% stability on generated LEGO structures and outperforms other baselines in mean brick stability and CLIP score. v) LEGOGPT provides AI practitioners with a framework integrating language models and physics constraints for generating realizable 3D structures directly from text, enhancing design automation and robotic assembly applications.  |
| Crosslingual Reasoning through Test-Time Scaling (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05408) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.05408))| JuliaKreutzerCohere, gentaiscool, Muennighoff, MJonibek, yongzx | This research demonstrates that scaling test-time inference compute for English-centric reasoning language models (RLMs) substantially improves their multilingual mathematical reasoning, though this benefit is domain-specific and less effective for low-resource languages. The study investigates the extent to which English-centric RLMs, finetuned with long chain-of-thoughts, can generalize reasoning capabilities across diverse languages and domains by scaling inference-time compute. The authors evaluated s1 models (Qwen2.5-Instruct finetuned on 1k English STEM samples) across various sizes on multilingual benchmarks (e.g., MGSM, Global-MMLU), analyzing the effects of increased thinking tokens, language forcing strategies, and emergent language-mixing patterns like "quote-and-think." Crosslingual test-time scaling significantly improves multilingual math reasoning for models ≥3B parameters (e.g., a 14B s1 model showed a +Δ9.4% average accuracy gain on MGSM with more thinking tokens), often outperforming larger baseline models; however, models show poor out-of-domain generalization from STEM to cultural commonsense reasoning. Practitioners should consider test-time compute scaling for English-centric RLMs (≥3B) to enhance multilingual reasoning in high-resource languages for STEM tasks, but recognize its limitations for low-resource languages and out-of-domain applications, where specialized multilingual training data is still crucial. |
| PlaceIt3D: Language-Guided Object Placement in Real 3D Scenes (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05288) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.05288))| abdo-eldesokey, zuluquebec, Aileron, Filippo8, Samir55 | This paper introduces PlaceIt3D, a novel task, benchmark, and dataset for language-guided 3D object placement in real scenes, along with a baseline method called PlaceWizard. The main objective is to develop a system that can find a physically plausible and semantically correct 3D position and orientation for an asset in a scene based on a natural language description, addressing the ambiguity of multiple valid solutions and complex 3D spatial reasoning. The proposed PlaceWizard method utilizes a point encoder for scene features, uniform spatial pooling, a pre-trained Point-BERT for asset encoding, and a Large Language Model (LLM) that processes these features and the text prompt to predict placement location, anchor objects (auxiliary), and rotation masks via specialized decoder heads. Primary results show PlaceWizard achieved a global constraint accuracy of 52.6% and a complete placement success rate of 29.4% on the new benchmark, significantly outperforming an adapted Reason3D baseline which scored 40.6% global constraint accuracy and 18.1% complete placement success. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that PlaceIt3D provides a challenging new benchmark and dataset for evaluating 3D LLMs, fostering the development of AI agents with enhanced capabilities for understanding and interacting with 3D environments based on natural language, crucial for robotics and AR/VR applications. |
| BrowseComp-ZH: Benchmarking Web Browsing Ability of Large Language
  Models in Chinese (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19314) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.19314))| Bruce Leon, HawkFaust, yeeeqichen99, MindYing, PALIN2018 | This paper introduces BrowseComp-ZH, a benchmark for evaluating the web browsing ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the Chinese language environment. The primary objective is to assess LLM agents on the Chinese web, considering its unique linguistic, infrastructural, and censorship-related complexities often overlooked by English-centric benchmarks. The methodology involves 289 reverse-engineered multi-hop questions spanning 11 diverse domains, subjected to a two-stage quality control protocol to ensure high difficulty and answer uniqueness, which were used to benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art LLMs and agentic search systems. Key results demonstrate that most models perform poorly, with many achieving accuracy rates below 10% and even the best-performing system, OpenAI's DeepResearch, reaching only 42.9% accuracy. For AI practitioners, this highlights a critical need to enhance LLMs' capabilities in effective retrieval, sophisticated reasoning, and information reconciliation to master complex web browsing tasks, particularly in non-English information ecosystems. |
| Chain-of-Thought Tokens are Computer Program Variables (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04955) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.04955))| Zhifang Sui, peiyiwang89, soliz1998 | i) This paper investigates the role of chain-of-thought (CoT) tokens in large language models (LLMs), proposing that they function similarly to variables in computer programs. ii) The research objective is to empirically study the function of CoT tokens, and whether they store intermediate values used in subsequent computations. iii) The methodology involves fine-tuning Qwen-2.5-1.5B on multi-digit multiplication and dynamic programming tasks, intervening on CoT tokens, and merging them into latent tokens to evaluate performance. iv) Results show that removing non-result tokens from CoT causes little performance drop, and the performance decreases by 9% when latent tokens store larger numbers in 4*5 DP problems indicating a computational complexity limit. v) The implication for AI practitioners is that LLMs treat CoT tokens similarly to program variables, so alternative forms of CoT should be explored to design more concise and efficient reasoning processes.  |

  Challenges, and Opportunities (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02567) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02567))| Minghao Fu, Jintao Guo, Xinjie Zhang, Flourish, Suikong | This paper surveys recent advancements in unified multimodal models integrating vision-language understanding and generation. The objective is to provide a comprehensive overview of current efforts to unify disparate architectural paradigms for multimodal understanding (often autoregressive) and generation (often diffusion-based). The paper reviews and categorizes existing unified models based on their core architecture (diffusion-based, autoregressive-based, or hybrid) and image tokenization strategies (e.g., pixel, semantic, learnable query), also compiling relevant datasets and benchmarks. The survey highlights a rapid growth, identifying over 40 distinct unified models emerging between 2023 and early 2025 (Fig. 1), with varied approaches such as Emu2 (LLaMA backbone, EVA-CLIP encoder, SDXL decoder) and Janus-Pro (DeepSeek-LLM backbone, SigLIP + VQGAN encoders). AI practitioners receive a structured guide to the diverse architectures (e.g., autoregressive MLLMs using semantic encoders like CLIP paired with diffusion decoders), key datasets (e.g., LAION 5.9B image-text pairs), and benchmarks, aiding the development and evaluation of sophisticated unified multimodal systems. |
| ZeroSearch: Incentivize the Search Capability of LLMs without Searching (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04588) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.04588))| Yingyan Hou, Xuanbo Fan, Zile Qiao, Hao Sun, SpaceProduct | ZEROSEARCH is a reinforcement learning framework that enhances LLM search capabilities by fine-tuning an LLM to simulate a search engine, thus avoiding real search engine interactions and associated API costs. Its objective is to improve LLMs' search and reasoning without the high costs and document quality unpredictability of live search engine interactions. The core methodology involves supervised fine-tuning of a "simulation LLM" to generate controlled-quality documents (relevant or noisy) for queries, coupled with a curriculum learning strategy that progressively increases retrieval difficulty during RL training, and a loss masking mechanism for retrieved tokens. ZEROSEARCH consistently outperforms real search engine-based methods, with a 14B parameter simulation LLM achieving an average Exact Match score of 33.97 across several question answering datasets, surpassing Google Search which scored 32.47, while demonstrating stable learning and generalizability. This offers AI practitioners a cost-effective and stable approach to develop LLMs with strong search and reasoning skills by simulating search environments, reducing reliance on expensive APIs and improving control over training data quality. |
| PrimitiveAnything: Human-Crafted 3D Primitive Assembly Generation with
  Auto-Regressive Transformer (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04622) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.04622))| Yiqin Zhu, Yanning Zhou, Jingwen Ye, loktarxiao, hyz317 | PrimitiveAnything introduces a novel framework for generating 3D primitive assemblies by learning from human-crafted abstractions using an auto-regressive transformer. The main objective is to enable the generation of high-quality primitive assemblies that align with human perception and maintain geometric fidelity across diverse 3D shape categories, by reformulating shape abstraction as a sequence generation task. The methodology involves an ambiguity-free parameterization scheme for multiple primitive types, a shape-conditioned decoder-only transformer for auto-regressive primitive generation, and a cascaded primitive decoder to model attribute dependencies, trained on a large-scale dataset of human-crafted abstractions. Primary results demonstrate superior performance, achieving a Voxel-IoU of 0.484 on the HumanPrim test set, significantly outperforming optimization-based methods like EMS (0.259) and MP (0.201). The principal implication for AI practitioners is a method to create semantically structured and editable 3D content that is lightweight and aligns with human cognitive processes, useful for applications requiring efficient and interpretable 3D representations, such as user-generated content in games or computer-aided design. |
| HunyuanCustom: A Multimodal-Driven Architecture for Customized Video
  Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04512) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.04512))| Yuan Zhou, Sen Liang, Zhengguang Zhou, Zhentao Yu, Teng Hu | HunyuanCustom is a novel multimodal-driven architecture for customized video generation that prioritizes subject consistency across image, audio, video, and text inputs. The primary objective is to enable flexible, user-defined video generation featuring specific subjects with robust identity preservation and multi-modal controllability. The framework, built on HunyuanVideo, incorporates a LLaVA-based text-image fusion module, an image ID enhancement module using temporal concatenation, and distinct injection mechanisms including an AudioNet for audio and a patchify-based feature-alignment network for video conditioning. HunyuanCustom significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a Face-Sim score of 0.627 for ID consistency, surpassing competitors in single- and multi-subject scenarios. This work offers AI practitioners a robust approach for developing highly controllable, identity-preserving video generation systems, with direct applications in areas requiring precise subject customization like virtual human creation and fine-grained video editing. |
| Beyond Recognition: Evaluating Visual Perspective Taking in Vision
  Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03821) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.03821))| Maciej Wołczyk, Michał Nauman, Piotr Miłoś, Alicja Ziarko, Gracjan | This research evaluates Vision Language Models' (VLMs) visual perspective taking (VPT) capabilities, revealing strong scene understanding but significant deficiencies in spatial reasoning and perspective-taking. The primary objective is to investigate the ability of state-of-the-art VLMs to perform visual perspective taking by assessing three levels of visual cognition: scene understanding, spatial reasoning, and visual perspective taking. The study employed 144 unique visual tasks featuring a humanoid minifigure and an object in systematically varied spatial configurations and viewpoints, with each task accompanied by 7 open-ended diagnostic questions; model responses were evaluated using a precision-based correctness metric. While VLMs excelled in scene understanding (e.g., GPT-4o achieved 100.0% correctness), their performance significantly declined for spatial reasoning (e.g., GPT-4o at 72.9% for minifigure orientation) and further deteriorated for visual perspective taking (e.g., GPT-4o at 59.0% for determining object location from the minifigure's viewpoint). The principal implication for AI practitioners is that current VLMs lack robust internal geometric and perspective-dependent spatial reasoning, indicating a need for future VLM development to integrate explicit geometric representations and tailored training protocols beyond surface-level object recognition for reliable application in complex, interactive domains. |
| Benchmarking LLMs' Swarm intelligence (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04364) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.04364))| Hao Sun, Ji-Rong Wen, Mowen Huang, 6cf | This paper introduces SwarmBench, a benchmark for evaluating the emergent swarm intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) operating as decentralized agents under strict local perception and communication constraints. The research aims to systematically assess whether LLMs can exhibit effective coordination and collective intelligence akin to natural swarms when faced with limited local information, by evaluating their performance on five multi-agent tasks (Pursuit, Synchronization, Foraging, Flocking, Transport) within a configurable 2D grid world. The methodology involves LLM-driven agents operating with a k × k local view (e.g., 5x5 in main experiments) and optional local messaging, evaluated in a zero-shot setting using metrics for task success and emergent group dynamics. Evaluations of thirteen LLMs revealed significant performance variability, with emergent physical group dynamics, such as behavioral variability (`std_action_entropy` correlating with score at r = 0.300), explaining approximately 24.5% of task score variance, while explicit communication characteristics showed a weaker influence. For AI practitioners, this implies that when designing LLM-based multi-agent systems under severe decentralization, focusing on enhancing emergent physical coordination strategies may yield more significant performance gains than solely refining explicit communication protocols, as current LLMs struggle with robust planning under such constraints. |
| Beyond Theorem Proving: Formulation, Framework and Benchmark for Formal
  Problem-Solving (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04528) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.04528))| Qinxiang Cao, Xingzhi Qi, Renqiu Xia, Xinhao Zheng, purewhite42 | This paper presents a principled formulation of problem-solving as a deterministic MDP, introduces FPS and D-FPS frameworks for process-verified solving in FTP environments, and new benchmarks with the RPE evaluation metric. The research aims to establish a rigorous and verifiable approach to formal problem-solving beyond traditional theorem proving, enabling AI agents to produce process-level auditable solutions. Key methodologies include defining problem-solving as a deterministic Markov Decision Process, implementing the Formal Problem-Solving (FPS) and Deductive FPS (D-FPS) frameworks in Lean 4, constructing three novel benchmarks (FormalMath500, MiniF2F-Solving, PutnamBench-Solving), and proposing Restricted Propositional Equivalence (RPE) for answer correctness evaluation. Primary results show that SOTA FTP models using FPS solved at most 23.77% of FormalMath500, 27.47% of MiniF2F-Solving, and 0.31% of PutnamBench-Solving according to RPE, while D-FPS, though achieving lower solving rates, yielded nearly zero incorrectly submitted answers. For AI practitioners, these frameworks and benchmarks provide essential tools for developing and evaluating AI systems capable of verifiable, step-by-step formal reasoning, critical for applications requiring high trustworthiness and auditable solution processes. |
| OmniGIRL: A Multilingual and Multimodal Benchmark for GitHub Issue
  Resolution (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04606) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.04606))| Jiachi Chen, Yanlin Wang, Runhan Jiang, Lianghong Guo, itaowe | The paper introduces OmniGIRL, a novel multilingual, multimodal, and multi-domain benchmark for GitHub issue resolution. The primary objective is to create a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in resolving diverse, real-world GitHub issues, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks regarding language, domain, and input modality. OmniGIRL was constructed by collecting 959 task instances from 15 popular repositories across four programming languages (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java) and eight domains, including issues with textual, image, and website link information, followed by execution-based verification. Evaluations show current LLMs have limited performance on OmniGIRL; notably, the best-performing model, GPT-40 with the Agentless-X method, resolved only 8.6% of the total issues, and for issues requiring image understanding, Claude-3.5-Sonnet resolved only 10.5% using an oracle retrieval method with image-augmented text. AI practitioners should be aware that current LLMs significantly struggle with complex, multilingual, and multimodal software engineering tasks like GitHub issue resolution, indicating a substantial need for improved model capabilities and methods to handle cross-file and multimodal contexts effectively. |
| OpenHelix: A Short Survey, Empirical Analysis, and Open-Source
  Dual-System VLA Model for Robotic Manipulation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03912) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.03912))| Xinyang Tong, Shuanghao Bai, Wenxuan Song, Pengxiang Ding, Can Cui | This paper presents OpenHelix, an open-source dual-system Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for robotic manipulation, alongside a survey and empirical analysis of dual-system VLA design choices. Its main objective is to systematically evaluate core design elements of dual-system VLA architectures, such as MLLM training, policy training, and integration strategies, and to propose an effective, low-cost open-source model based on these findings. The study employs empirical evaluations on the CALVIN benchmark, varying MLLM training (frozen, fine-tuning, prompt-tuning), policy training (from scratch, fine-tuning pre-trained), and integration strategies (projector pre-alignment, auxiliary tasks), leading to the OpenHelix model which uses prompt-tuned LLaVA-7B and a pre-trained 3D Diffuser Actor policy with an auxiliary multimodal reasoning task. Key results demonstrate that MLLM prompt tuning with an auxiliary task significantly improves performance, with the proposed configuration achieving a 4.01 average task completion length on CALVIN (Table 7) and 46.9% 5-task completion success on CALVIN ABC-D with 60-step asynchronous inference (Table 8). For AI practitioners, this implies that prompt-tuning large MLLMs with auxiliary tasks for enhanced visual reasoning, coupled with careful pre-alignment of dual-system components, is a highly effective strategy for robotic VLA development, and that asynchronous inference between systems often has minimal impact on overall performance. |
| OSUniverse: Benchmark for Multimodal GUI-navigation AI Agents (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03570) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.03570))| Sinéad Ryan, Arturo Márquez Flores, Patrick Barker, Daniel Jeffries, mariya-davydova | The paper introduces OSUniverse, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal GUI-navigation AI agents on complex desktop tasks with automated validation. The main objective is to provide a robust, extensible benchmark with increasing task complexity to measure the capabilities of GUI-navigation AI agents and to assess current state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. The methodology involves defining tasks in YAML, running them in Dockerized desktop environments (AgentDesk) using a SurfKit-compatible runtime, and employing automated validation with Gemini models for scoring, supplemented by a human review interface. Primary results show that SOTA agents (at publication) achieve less than 50% accuracy, with the top agent (`computer-use-preview-2025-03-11`) scoring 47.80%; the automated validation mechanism exhibits an average error rate below 2% (1.64% with Gemini 2.0 Flash). The principal implication for AI practitioners is that OSUniverse provides a challenging and calibrated benchmark with automated, non-deterministic validation to assess GUI-navigation agents, highlighting that even top proprietary models require custom agentic code and specialized training for optimal performance, with open-weight models lagging. |
| Knowledge Augmented Complex Problem Solving with Large Language Models:
  A Survey (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03418) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.03418))| Yuqi Zhu, Yuchen Tian, Junwei Su, Lun Du, Da Zheng | This survey examines the capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving, focusing on multi-step reasoning, knowledge augmentation, and result verification across various domains. The paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current LLM techniques for tackling complex problems, highlight challenges such as data scarcity and computational costs, and discuss future research directions. The survey analyzes methodologies including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-step problem decomposition, knowledge augmentation via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and knowledge graphs, and various result verification techniques such as LLM-based verifiers and tool-assisted validation. Key findings highlighted include the inference scaling law, where solution coverage can grow nearly log-linearly with the number of sampled reasoning paths [10], and that training dedicated verifier models significantly improves solve rates on tasks like GSM8K math problems compared to only fine-tuning the generator LLM [20]. For AI practitioners, this implies that LLM problem-solving can be substantially enhanced by systematically integrating structured reasoning processes, incorporating external knowledge sources, and employing robust verification loops, while also needing to address the high computational demands of extensive search and reasoning. |
| R&B: Domain Regrouping and Data Mixture Balancing for Efficient
  Foundation Model Training (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00358) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.00358))| Ziyi Chu, Avi Trost, John Cooper, Tzu-Heng Huang, Albert Ge | R&B is a two-stage framework that improves foundation model training efficiency by first re-partitioning data based on semantic similarity (Regroup) and then dynamically optimizing data mixture proportions using domain gradients (Balance). The paper addresses how to overcome the limitations of predetermined data domains and the computational inefficiency of existing data mixing methods in foundation model training. R&B employs semantic clustering (e.g., k-means on embeddings) for data regrouping and leverages a Gram matrix of domain gradients, updated during training, to dynamically reweight skill mixtures via a regularized softmax optimization. Empirically, R&B matches or exceeds state-of-the-art data mixing performance while significantly reducing computational overhead, requiring as little as 0.01% additional compute; for instance, on SUP-NATINST, R&B achieved a loss of 2.381 with 0.009% overhead. AI practitioners can significantly reduce computational costs and potentially improve performance in foundation model training by adopting semantic data regrouping and gradient-based dynamic mixture balancing, avoiding expensive per-skill evaluations. |
| Uncertainty-Weighted Image-Event Multimodal Fusion for Video Anomaly
  Detection (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02393) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02393))| Mohsen Imani, Paper9795, Eavn | This paper introduces IEF-VAD, a framework that synthesizes event representations from RGB videos and fuses them with image features using an uncertainty-aware process, aiming to enhance video anomaly detection by integrating temporal cues from synthetic event data with spatial RGB information. The key methodology involves extracting image and synthetic event features via CLIP, modeling sensor noise with a Student's-t likelihood, and deriving inverse-variance weights through Laplace approximation for fusion. Furthermore, IEF-VAD employs Kalman-style sequential updates and an iterative refinement network to denoise the fused latent state before classification using a composite loss function including KL divergence and modality alignment terms. IEF-VAD achieved state-of-the-art results, such as an AUC of 88.67% on UCF-Crime and 92.90% on MSAD (Student's-t model), with masking experiments confirming adaptive uncertainty weighting. For AI practitioners, this work shows that fusing synthetic event data with RGB data via principled uncertainty estimation (e.g., Student's-t noise model, inverse-variance weighting) can significantly improve video anomaly detection by capturing motion cues without dedicated event sensors, offering a practical enhancement for video understanding systems. |
| Cognitio Emergens: Agency, Dimensions, and Dynamics in Human-AI
  Knowledge Co-Creation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03105) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.03105))| linxule | This paper introduces Cognitio Emergens (CE), a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding and guiding the co-evolutionary nature of human-AI partnerships in scientific knowledge co-creation. The primary objective is to propose the CE framework to address limitations in existing models by capturing the dynamic, emergent, and co-evolutionary processes through which scientific understanding is co-created. The methodology is primarily theoretical, synthesizing theories like autopoiesis and social systems theory to define CE through three core components: Agency Configurations, Epistemic Dimensions, and Partnership Dynamics. The primary result is the CE framework itself, detailing three Agency Configurations, six Epistemic Dimensions (e.g., Divergent Intelligence, Synthesis Intelligence) forming "capability signatures" (Section 3.2.4) for diagnostic purposes, and six Partnership Dynamics; the paper, being a framework proposal, does not present empirical quantitative findings. For AI practitioners, CE offers tools to design AI systems as evolving epistemic partners, focusing on dynamic agency and specific collaborative capabilities rather than solely on narrow performance metrics. |

| Unified Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reward Model through Reinforcement
  Fine-Tuning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03318) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.03318))| Qinglin Lu, Chunyu Wang, Zhimin Li, Yibin Wang, yuhangzang | This paper introduces UNIFIEDREWARD-THINK, a unified multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reward model enhanced by reinforcement fine-tuning to improve reward signal accuracy for visual understanding and generation tasks. The main objective is to enable reliable, multi-dimensional CoT reasoning in reward models by eliciting and incentivizing latent complex reasoning capabilities, despite the scarcity of explicit CoT supervision data. The key methodology employs a three-stage training pipeline: (1) cold-starting by distilling CoT reward format from GPT-4o, (2) refining through rejection sampling on large-scale unified preference data, and (3) leveraging Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for reinforcement fine-tuning using verifiable format and accuracy rewards. UNIFIEDREWARD-THINK achieved superior performance, for example, attaining a 72.3% macro accuracy on the VLRewardBench for image understanding, compared to 66.6% by the UnifiedReward baseline, and also demonstrated improved implicit reasoning capabilities when CoT was not explicitly output. For AI practitioners, this work offers a method to develop more accurate and interpretable multimodal reward models by incorporating CoT through reinforcement learning, which can significantly enhance the alignment of vision models with human preferences, even with limited explicit CoT data. |
| Absolute Zero: Reinforced Self-play Reasoning with Zero Data (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03335) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.03335))| Andrew Zhao, zlzheng, shenzhi-wang, Yang130, kevinwyr | This paper introduces Absolute Zero, an RLVR paradigm where a model self-improves reasoning by autonomously proposing and solving tasks using only a code executor for verifiable rewards, without any external data. The research aims to develop a system where a large language model can enhance its reasoning capabilities purely through self-play, eliminating reliance on human-curated data for task definition or solution verification. The core methodology involves the Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR), a single model acting as both a task proposer (rewarded for task learnability) and a solver (rewarded for solution correctness) for self-generated coding tasks (deduction, abduction, induction), with a code executor providing feedback and Task-Relative REINFORCE++ for updates. AZR, trained entirely without external data, achieved state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous zero-setting models that used curated data by an average of 1.8 absolute points on combined coding and math reasoning benchmarks. This paradigm offers AI practitioners a pathway to build more autonomous reasoning systems capable of self-generating training curricula and improving without continuous human data supervision, potentially overcoming data bottlenecks and enabling learning beyond human-provided tasks. |
| FlexiAct: Towards Flexible Action Control in Heterogeneous Scenarios (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03730) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.03730))| Yansong Tang, Ying Shan, Zhaoyang Zhang, Shiyi Zhang, JunhaoZhuang | FlexiAct proposes a novel framework for transferring actions from a reference video to an arbitrary target image, achieving flexible action control in heterogeneous scenarios with varying spatial structures while maintaining appearance consistency. The main objective is to overcome the limitations of existing action customization methods that require strict spatial alignment (layout, skeleton, viewpoint) between reference and target, by enabling action transfer across diverse subjects and domains. The methodology involves two key components: RefAdapter, a lightweight image-conditioned adapter for spatial adaptation and consistency preservation, and Frequency-aware Action Extraction (FAE), which dynamically adjusts attention to frequency-specific embeddings during the denoising process to precisely extract motion. Experiments show FlexiAct effectively transfers actions in diverse scenarios; in human evaluations, FlexiAct was preferred over a base model for motion consistency (79.5% vs. 20.5%) and appearance consistency (78.3% vs. 21.7%). For AI practitioners, FlexiAct offers a robust method for action-conditioned video generation where reference and target subjects differ significantly, broadening applications in animation and content creation by decoupling action from strict spatial constraints and utilizing dynamic, frequency-aware attention modulation. |
| RADLADS: Rapid Attention Distillation to Linear Attention Decoders at
  Scale (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03005) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.03005))| Eugene Cheah, Janna Lu, Eric Alcaide, SmerkyG | The paper introduces RADLADS, a rapid and cost-effective protocol for converting pre-trained softmax attention transformers into performant linear attention decoder models, alongside two new RWKV-variant architectures, RAD-RWKV6 and RAD-RWKV7. The primary objective is to develop a highly efficient method to distill knowledge from large softmax attention transformers into linear attention models, requiring significantly less data (350-700M tokens, <0.005% of original pre-training data) and compute than full pre-training, while preserving near-original model quality and achieving state-of-the-art performance for linear attention models. RADLADS employs a three-step conversion: 1) Attention Weights Transfer from the teacher, 2) Attention Hidden State Alignment using L2 loss on 100M tokens to match teacher attention hidden states, and 3) Knowledge Distillation of teacher output logits using Kullback-Leibler divergence loss on 250M-700M tokens, followed by optional fine-tuning. A key result is that a converted 72B Qwen2.5 model (QRWKV6-72B-Instruct) achieved an MMLU score of 0.754, closely matching its teacher's 0.751, establishing new state-of-the-art downstream performance for a pure RNN language model of its size. For AI practitioners, RADLADS offers a practical pathway to create large-scale, inference-efficient linear attention models from existing powerful softmax transformers with significantly reduced costs, facilitating broader adoption of models with O(1) per-token inference complexity. |
| RetroInfer: A Vector-Storage Approach for Scalable Long-Context LLM
  Inference (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02922) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02922))| Chengruidong Zhang, Jinkai Zhang, Yaoqi Chen, qianxizhang, baotonglu | RetroInfer presents a novel vector-storage system to accelerate long-context Large Language Model (LLM) inference by exploiting attention sparsity. The primary objective is to address GPU memory and bandwidth constraints that hinder efficient inference for LLMs with extended context lengths. Its core methodology involves the "wave index," an Attention-aWare Vector index for retrieving critical tokens using tripartite attention approximation, accuracy-bounded estimation, and segmented clustering, complemented by a "wave buffer" for coordinating KV cache placement and hardware operations. Experiments demonstrate up to 4.5x speedup over full attention within GPU memory limits and up to 10.5x over sparse attention baselines when extending KV cache to CPU memory, while maintaining full-attention-level accuracy. For AI practitioners, RetroInfer offers a system to significantly improve throughput and scalability for deploying LLMs with very long contexts without compromising model accuracy. |
| Decoding Open-Ended Information Seeking Goals from Eye Movements in
  Reading (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02872) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02872))| Yevgeni Berzak, Yoav Meiri, Omer Shubi, Cfir Avraham Hadar | This research investigates decoding open-ended, text-specific information-seeking goals from readers' eye movements using multimodal LLMs. The primary objective is to determine if a reader's specific question for a text can be automatically decoded from their eye movements, assessed via goal classification and reconstruction tasks. The methodology involves discriminative (adapted Haller RNN, ROBERTEye-Fixations) and novel generative (DalEye-LLaVA, DalEye-Llama) multimodal LLMs combining text and eye-tracking features from the OneStop dataset. ROBERTEye-Fixations achieved the highest classification accuracy at 49.3% overall (chance 33.0%), and significantly, 57.3% (chance 49.9%) in distinguishing questions over identical text spans, demonstrating extraction of fine-grained goal information. This suggests AI practitioners can leverage eye-tracking with LLMs to infer user-specific information needs for personalized systems, though precise goal generation requires further advancement. |
| An Empirical Study of Qwen3 Quantization (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02214) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02214))| Xudong Ma, Yue Feng, Yuye Li, HaoranChu, Xingyu-Zheng | This paper empirically evaluates the quantization robustness of the Qwen3 LLM series using five post-training quantization (PTQ) methods across bit-widths from 1 to 8 bits. The study's main objective is to systematically assess Qwen3's performance degradation under various quantization settings to identify opportunities and challenges in compressing these state-of-the-art models. The methodology involves applying five PTQ techniques (RTN, GPTQ, AWQ, SmoothQuant, BiLLM) to Qwen3 models, testing weight-only (1-8 bits) and weight-activation quantization, with performance measured on perplexity, 0-shot reasoning tasks, and 5-shot MMLU. Primary results indicate that while Qwen3 achieves near-lossless performance at 8-bit quantization, it shows noticeable degradation at 4-bits (e.g., Qwen3-8B's MMLU score drops from 74.7 in FP16 to 69.3 with 4-bit AWQ per-group quantization) and experiences more pronounced degradation at 3-bits or fewer, particularly compared to previous model generations. Principal implication for AI practitioners: When deploying Qwen3, practitioners can expect robust performance with 8-bit quantization, but must carefully evaluate the noticeable performance trade-offs at 4-bits and the significant degradation at 3-bits or below, indicating a need for advanced quantization strategies or careful capability assessments for ultra-low precision applications of these models. |
| Multi-Agent System for Comprehensive Soccer Understanding (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03735) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.03735))| Yanfeng Wang, Ya Zhang, Zifeng Li, haoningwu, Homie0609 | This paper introduces SoccerAgent, a multi-agent system for holistic soccer understanding, accompanied by SoccerWiki, a multimodal knowledge base, and SoccerBench, a comprehensive benchmark. The main research objective is to develop a comprehensive framework for AI-driven soccer understanding that moves beyond isolated tasks to enable knowledge-driven reasoning. The key methodology involves constructing SoccerWiki with information on 9,471 players and 266 teams, creating SoccerBench with ~10K multimodal multi-choice QA pairs across 13 tasks, and developing SoccerAgent, a multi-agent system that decomposes questions and invokes 18 specialized tools. SoccerAgent achieved 85.0% accuracy on TextQA tasks and 60.9% on VideoQA tasks within SoccerBench, outperforming existing Multimodal Large Language Models. The principal implication for AI practitioners is the provision of a new benchmark (SoccerBench) and a multi-agent system architecture (SoccerAgent) that demonstrates effective task decomposition and tool utilization for complex, domain-specific multimodal understanding, offering a template for similar AI applications. |
| Geospatial Mechanistic Interpretability of Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03368) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.03368))| Kevin Roitero, Stefano Mizzaro, sdesabbata | This paper introduces a framework using spatial analysis and sparse autoencoders to interpret how Large Language Models internally represent geographical information. Its objective is to understand the internal mechanisms LLMs use to process and encode geospatial data. The study extracted activations from Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 for placename prompts, analyzed them using spatial autocorrelation, then applied sparse autoencoders to decompose activations from layer 15 into features, which were also spatially analyzed. While 14.98% of raw neuron activations across multiple layers exhibited polysemantic spatial patterns, sparse autoencoder decomposition of layer 15 activations yielded only 0.2% (67 of 32,768) of features with significant spatial autocorrelation, indicating sparse, though sometimes more monosemantic, geospatial encoding and highlighting areas for further research in decomposition techniques. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that this framework offers a method to interpret LLMs' complex and sparsely distributed geographical representations, which is critical for developing more reliable and well-understood foundation models for geospatial applications by revealing how models internally handle such data. |
| InfoVids: Reimagining the Viewer Experience with Alternative
  Visualization-Presenter Relationships (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03164) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.03164))| Kevin Hsu, Ivy Chen, Tongyu Zhou, Ji Won Chung, Franck-Dernoncourt | This paper introduces "InfoVids," an augmented reality (AR) paradigm that integrates presenters and visualizations within a shared 3D space to enhance viewer experience compared to traditional 2D slide-based presentations. The primary objective is to investigate how these alternative spatial arrangements and interactions affect viewer engagement, perceived presenter immersion, and attention dynamics. Researchers developed four InfoVid case technology probes using ARKit and a custom Body Object Model (BOM), which were then compared against 2D baseline equivalents by 30 public participants through surveys and semi-structured interviews. Results showed InfoVids significantly shifted viewer attention towards the presenter (e.g., for AIRPLANEVIS, 16 out of 30 participants shifted focus to the presenter) and were generally perceived as more engaging and immersive. For AI practitioners developing data communication or presentation tools, this research indicates that co-locating presenters and AR visualizations can create more human-centric experiences, suggesting a valuable approach for designing AI-driven data storytelling systems that prioritize presenter engagement. |
| VITA-Audio: Fast Interleaved Cross-Modal Token Generation for Efficient
  Large Speech-Language Model (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03739) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.03739))| Lijiang Li, Heting Gao, Chaoyou Fu, Yunhang Shen, Zuwei Long | VITA-Audio is an end-to-end large speech model designed for fast interleaved cross-modal token generation to reduce high first-audio-token latency in streaming applications. The primary objective is to achieve real-time audio generation within end-to-end speech models, specifically enabling zero audio token delay after the initial LLM forward pass. This is accomplished using lightweight Multiple Cross-modal Token Prediction (MCTP) modules that efficiently generate multiple audio tokens directly from LLM hidden states within a single model forward pass, combined with a four-stage progressive training strategy. VITA-Audio demonstrates a 3-5x inference speedup at the 7B parameter scale and reduces the first audio token chunk generation time from 236ms (Vanilla mode) to 53ms (Boost mode). The principal implication for AI practitioners is that VITA-Audio offers an effective architecture for developing highly responsive, real-time conversational AI systems by enabling immediate audio output from the first forward pass. |
| Invoke Interfaces Only When Needed: Adaptive Invocation for Large
  Language Models in Question Answering (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02311) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02311))| Biao Qin, Chunlai Zhou, Robot2050 | This paper proposes AttenHScore, an unsupervised metric for adaptive LLM invocation in Question Answering by detecting Small Language Model (SLM) hallucinations in real-time, complemented by an uncertainty-aware text re-ranking strategy. The main objective is to precisely determine when to invoke a large language model (LLM) if a small language model (SLM) is likely hallucinating, thereby optimizing the trade-off between performance and cost in collaborative LM systems. The key methodology involves "AttenHScore," which calculates the accumulation and propagation of hallucinations during SLM generation using token probabilities (Pmax(xi)) and attention scores (Atten(xi)), and an uncertainty-based re-ranking of retrieved documents by guiding SLMs to generate queries from text chunks. Primary results show AttenHScore outperforms baselines; for example, with Llama3-8B-Instruct on SQuAD, it achieved an AUCS of 0.8715 and ACCr of 0.8176. The re-ranking strategy improved the F1 score of Vicuna-7B-v1.5 by 3.37 on MultiFieldQA-zh. The principal implication for AI practitioners is the provision of a plug-and-play, unsupervised method to reduce computational costs and improve QA system efficiency by adaptively invoking expensive LLMs only when SLMs demonstrate signs of hallucination, without needing additional model training. |
| HoloTime: Taming Video Diffusion Models for Panoramic 4D Scene
  Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21650) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.21650))| Yonghong Tian, Xinhua Cheng, Jiawen Guan, Haiyang Zhou, Drexubery | HoloTime is a novel framework that generates immersive panoramic 4D scenes from images or prompts by integrating specialized video diffusion for panoramic video creation and a robust 4D reconstruction pipeline. Its primary objective is to overcome the limitations of existing methods in producing truly immersive, dynamic 360-degree 4D scene-level assets for VR/AR applications. The methodology combines the "360World" dataset of fixed-camera panoramic videos, a "Panoramic Animator" (a two-stage motion-guided image-to-video diffusion model with hybrid fine-tuning and panoramic circular techniques), and "Panoramic Space-Time Reconstruction" (using space-time aligned depth estimation and 4D Gaussian Splatting). The framework demonstrates superior performance, with HoloTime achieving an 87.74% user preference for graphics quality in image-driven 4D scene generation compared to 3D-Cinemagraphy (1.94%), and significantly higher user ratings for text-driven panoramic video quality. For AI practitioners, HoloTime offers a method to create high-fidelity, spatially and temporally consistent panoramic 4D environments, enhancing immersive experiences, and provides the 360World dataset as a resource for developing similar panoramic video generation models. |
| Auto-SLURP: A Benchmark Dataset for Evaluating Multi-Agent Frameworks in
  Smart Personal Assistant (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18373) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.18373))| Xiaoyu Shen, lorashen | This paper introduces Auto-SLURP, a benchmark dataset for evaluating LLM-based multi-agent frameworks for smart personal assistants. The main objective is to provide a standardized benchmark for comprehensive end-to-end evaluation of these frameworks, covering language understanding, task execution, and response generation. Auto-SLURP extends the original SLURP dataset by relabeling slots and integrating simulated servers and external services, with experiments conducted on frameworks like CamelAI, LangGraph, AutoGen, and AgentLite using GPT-4. Primary results show AgentLite achieved the highest accuracy at 0.46, and finetuning an intent agent (LLAMA-3 8B) on AutoGen improved its accuracy from 0.40 to 0.62, a 55% performance increase. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that Auto-SLURP offers a challenging testbed for developing and iterating on more reliable multi-agent personal assistant systems, revealing that current frameworks require significant improvement, especially in areas like intent processing. |


## Papers for 2025-05-06

| Title | Authors | Summary |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Voila: Voice-Language Foundation Models for Real-Time Autonomous
  Interaction and Voice Role-Play (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02707) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02707))| Yu Shu, Yemin Shi, zhitinghu, Jaward, guangyil | The paper introduces Voila, a family of open-sourced, end-to-end voice-language foundation models designed for real-time, autonomous, and emotionally expressive human-AI interaction, supporting tasks like dialogue, ASR, and TTS. Its primary objective is to enable voice AI agents to interact autonomously and proactively by moving beyond reactive pipeline systems towards full-duplex, low-latency conversations preserving rich vocal nuances. Voila utilizes a hierarchical multi-scale Transformer architecture with an LLM backbone and a hierarchical audio generator, a novel voice tokenizer (Voila-Tokenizer) that distills semantic and acoustic information into layered RVQ tokens, and a structured text-audio interleaved alignment strategy for multi-task training. Voila achieves a response latency of 195 milliseconds and an accuracy of 30.56 on its custom Voila Benchmark, significantly outperforming prior models, and a 2.7% Word Error Rate for ASR on LibriSpeech test-clean (when trained with LibriSpeech data). This provides AI practitioners with an open-source foundation for developing next-generation autonomous voice AI systems with improved naturalness, responsiveness, and customizability, offering a unified model that effectively integrates LLM reasoning with nuanced voice processing. |
| RM-R1: Reward Modeling as Reasoning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02387) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02387))| Ziqi Wang, zhangdenghui123, Merlin-Hongru, gaotang, XtremSup | The paper introduces RM-R1, a family of Reasoning Reward Models (REASRMS) that formulate reward modeling as an explicit reasoning task to enhance LLM alignment. The research aims to improve the interpretability and performance of reward models for LLMs by integrating deep, interpretable reasoning capabilities into the reward generation and judgment process. RM-R1 is trained using a two-stage pipeline involving: 1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains, often employing a Chain-of-Rubrics (CoR) framework, from stronger teacher models, and 2) subsequent reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). RM-R1 models demonstrate state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance, outperforming significantly larger open-weight and proprietary models by up to 13.8% on benchmarks like RewardBench, where RM-R1-QWEN-INSTRUCT-32B achieved 92.9% overall accuracy. AI practitioners can develop more robust, accurate, and interpretable LLM alignment systems by shifting from opaque scalar rewards to generative reward models that explicitly reason and justify their judgments, particularly through structured reasoning distillation and targeted RL. |
| Grokking in the Wild: Data Augmentation for Real-World Multi-Hop
  Reasoning with Transformers (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20752) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.20752))| Gjergji Kasneci, Roman Abramov, fsteinbauer | This paper demonstrates that augmenting real-world knowledge graphs with synthetic data to increase the ratio of inferred to atomic facts ($\phi_r$) enables Transformers to "grok" multi-hop reasoning, achieving high performance on factual question answering. The main research objective was to determine if Transformers can achieve "grokking" (transitioning from memorization to generalization) on real-world multi-hop factual reasoning tasks by synthetically increasing the ratio of inferred facts to atomic facts ($\phi_r$) in the training data above a critical threshold. The key methodology involved augmenting the 2WikiMultiHopQA dataset by generating synthetic atomic and multi-hop (inferred) facts to elevate the relation-specific ratio $\phi_r$ (e.g., to an achieved ratio of 8 for comparison tasks). A GPT-2 small model was then trained from scratch on this augmented data for an extended period (e.g., ~300k steps). The primary result showed that the grokked GPT-2 small model achieved 96% Out-of-Distribution (OOD) accuracy on the 2WikiMultiHopQA structured comparison task, significantly outperforming larger models like GPT-4o (reported at 87% for the same task average in Figure 1, or 0.87 for comparison in Table 3) and o1-mini (reported at 89% in Figure 1, or 0.88 for comparison in Table 3) which did not undergo the same data augmentation. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that targeted data augmentation to ensure a high density of multi-step inference examples relative to atomic facts can unlock robust multi-hop reasoning capabilities even in smaller Transformer models, offering a pathway to more efficient and potentially more interpretable factual reasoning systems without solely relying on model scale. (The paper's arXiv date is listed as "29 Apr 2025", which is unusual.) |
| FormalMATH: Benchmarking Formal Mathematical Reasoning of Large Language
  Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02735) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02735))| ZhengYuan, yifanzhang114, Liam-Liu, prt66, zhouliang | This paper introduces FormalMATH, a large-scale Lean4 benchmark with 5,560 formally verified problems to evaluate the formal mathematical reasoning of large language models. The primary objective is to address limitations in the scope and scale of existing formal mathematics benchmarks and to rigorously assess current LLM-based theorem provers. FormalMATH was created via a human-in-the-loop autoformalization pipeline integrating specialized LLMs for statement generation, multi-LLM semantic verification, and negation-based disproof, achieving a 72.09% pass rate for candidate statements undergoing final manual expert verification. Evaluations on FormalMATH showed that even the strongest LLM-based theorem provers have significant limitations, achieving only a 16.46% success rate (Pass@32), and revealed that natural-language solution guidance can negatively impact formal proof success in chain-of-thought scenarios. FormalMATH offers a robust benchmark for advancing LLM-based formal theorem proving, highlighting needs for improved cross-domain generalization, deeper deductive capabilities beyond simple automation, and better integration of formal and informal reasoning. |
| ReplaceMe: Network Simplification via Layer Pruning and Linear
  Transformations (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02819) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02819))| szagoruyko121, stamatisl, madrugado, ammarali32, dimitriish | ReplaceMe is a generalized training-free depth pruning method that replaces contiguous transformer blocks with an estimated linear transformation, maintaining high performance. The main objective is to simplify transformer networks by pruning layers and approximating their functionality with a single linear operation, estimated using a small calibration dataset, without requiring retraining. The key methodology involves identifying prunable blocks based on inter-layer activation distances (cosine distance preferred) and then computing an optimal linear transformation (LT) to replace these blocks, which is subsequently merged into a remaining layer. Primary results show that ReplaceMe can prune up to 25% of a Llama 2 7B model while retaining 92.5% of its original performance on open benchmarks using the cosine distance objective for LT estimation, significantly outperforming UIDL in compression time and environmental impact. For AI practitioners, ReplaceMe offers a computationally efficient, training-free approach to compress large language models, reducing latency and resource demands with minimal performance loss, thus facilitating more accessible deployment. |
| Optimizing Chain-of-Thought Reasoners via Gradient Variance Minimization
  in Rejection Sampling and RL (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02391) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02391))| nanjiang, WeiXiong, hendrydong, HanningZhang, FlippyDora | This paper introduces GVM-RAFT, a dynamic sample allocation strategy that optimizes Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoner training by minimizing stochastic gradient variance. The primary objective is to improve the efficiency of CoT training, which often suffers from inefficient stochastic gradient estimation due to static sampling strategies, by dynamically allocating computational resources based on prompt-specific characteristics. GVM-RAFT proposes a prompt-specific Dynamic Sample Allocation Strategy that monitors prompt acceptance rates and stochastic gradient norms to minimize gradient variance under a computational budget, derived within an Expectation-Maximization framework. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks show that GVM-RAFT achieves a 2-4× speedup in convergence and considerable accuracy improvements over vanilla RAFT, for instance, GVM-RAFT++ improved the 5-benchmark average accuracy from 36.42% to 39.64% on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B. AI practitioners can utilize this method to more efficiently fine-tune CoT models through rejection sampling or reinforcement learning, by adaptively allocating inference budgets to different prompts, thus accelerating training and enhancing final model accuracy. |
| Practical Efficiency of Muon for Pretraining (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02222) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02222))| cadarsh-essential, monk-essential, karlstratos, ampolloreno, ishaan-essential | This research demonstrates Muon, a second-order optimizer, expands the compute-time Pareto frontier over AdamW for pretraining and introduces an efficient muP-based telescoping hyperparameter tuning method. Its main objective is to investigate Muon's practical efficiency compared to AdamW in large-scale language model pretraining, particularly the compute-time tradeoff and hyperparameter selection. Key methodology involved comparing optimizers via iso-loss frontiers on a compute-time plane using models up to 4 billion parameters, and developing a "telescoping" algorithm for maximal update parameterization (muP) that accounts for error sources. Primary results indicate Muon requires 10-15% fewer tokens than AdamW to achieve an identical loss, and the telescoping algorithm enables allocating over 20% of the total compute budget to the final model training run while ensuring near-optimal hyperparameters. For AI practitioners, this implies Muon offers a more data-efficient pretraining alternative to AdamW, especially at large batch sizes, and the telescoping muP approach facilitates cost-effective hyperparameter tuning, reducing overall training time and computational resources. |
| A Survey on Inference Engines for Large Language Models: Perspectives on
  Optimization and Efficiency (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01658) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.01658))| Sungryeol Jeon, leejaymin, Devcow, oos2, inputsh | This paper presents a comprehensive survey of 25 LLM inference engines, evaluating their optimization techniques, hardware support, and ecosystem maturity to guide efficient deployment. The primary objective is to systematically compare these open-source and commercial engines, identifying their design goals, supported features, and suitability for throughput- or latency-sensitive LLM services. The methodology involves analyzing each engine's architecture, supported optimization categories (e.g., parallelism, compression, caching per Table 7), hardware compatibility (Table 4), and non-technical indicators like GitHub activity and documentation quality (Table 3). Key findings show significant diversity: engines like Ollama gained high user preference (209.6 average daily GitHub star growth) for ease of use, while solutions like vLLM and TensorRT-LLM offer extensive, specialized optimizations for demanding server-side inference, supporting techniques such as PagedAttention and various parallelisms. The principal implication for AI practitioners is a structured guide for selecting optimal inference engines based on specific performance requirements, hardware constraints, and the trade-offs between ease-of-use, feature support, and ecosystem maturity, facilitating more efficient and cost-effective LLM service deployment. |

  Learning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02835) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02835))| KevinTowne, KaiyuValley, bhsc24, XingyuLu, yifanzhang114 | This paper introduces R1-Reward, a multimodal reward model (MRM) trained via a novel StableReinforce algorithm to enhance reward modeling through stable reinforcement learning. The primary objective is to explore and improve the application of reinforcement learning (RL) for multimodal reward modeling by addressing the instability issues of existing RL algorithms in this context. The key methodology involves reformulating reward modeling as a rule-based RL task and developing StableReinforce, which incorporates refined training loss (Pre-CLIP), advantage estimation (Advantage Filter), and a novel consistency reward mechanism using an MLLM referee. R1-Reward achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating a 14.3% improvement on the Multimodal Reward Bench compared to previous SOTA models. For AI practitioners, this work provides a robust method (StableReinforce) and a high-performing model (R1-Reward) for developing more accurate MRMs, crucial for improving MLLM alignment, data filtering, and evaluation. |
| Think on your Feet: Adaptive Thinking via Reinforcement Learning for
  Social Agents (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02156) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02156))| Xinghua Zhang, Haobo Wang, bingliwu, Yongbin-Li, iiiiwis | This paper introduces Adaptive Mode Learning (AML) with an Adaptive Mode Policy Optimization (AMPO) algorithm to enable social agents to dynamically adjust reasoning depth in social interactions. The main objective is to develop language agents that can dynamically adjust their reasoning depth based on real-time context in social simulations, unlike current approaches that use fixed reasoning depths or lack reasoning capabilities. The key methodology involves defining four thinking modes (intuitive reaction to deep contemplation) and using the AMPO algorithm, which incorporates multi-granular thinking mode design, context-aware mode switching, and token-efficient reasoning, trained via behavioral cloning and reinforcement learning. Primary results show AML achieves 15.6% higher task performance than state-of-the-art methods, and notably, outperforms GRPO by 7.0% in performance with 32.8% shorter reasoning chains. For AI practitioners, AMPO provides a framework to develop more human-like, adaptive, and token-efficient social agents capable of context-sensitive reasoning in complex social environments. |
| SkillMimic-V2: Learning Robust and Generalizable Interaction Skills from
  Sparse and Noisy Demonstrations (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02094) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02094))| Hok Wai Tsui, Yinhuai Wang, cqf, Crimnos, IngridYU | SkillMimic-V2 introduces a framework for learning robust and generalizable robot interaction skills from sparse and noisy demonstrations by augmenting data and employing adaptive training. The main research objective is to overcome demonstration noise and coverage limitations in Reinforcement Learning from Interaction Demonstration (RLID), enabling robots to learn complex skills from limited and imperfect human demonstrations. The key methodology involves two data augmentation techniques—Stitched Trajectory Graph (STG) and State Transition Field (STF)—an Adaptive Trajectory Sampling (ATS) strategy for curriculum generation, and a History Encoder (HE) for memory-dependent skills. The method enhances generalization performance by over 35%; for instance, on the BallPlay-M benchmark, it achieved an average ε-Neighborhood Success Rate (εNSR) of 49.3% compared to 18.3% for the baseline SkillMimic (SM). The principal implication for AI practitioners is that this approach allows for the training of AI agents for complex physical interaction tasks using sparse and noisy demonstrations, significantly improving skill robustness and generalization beyond the provided data. |
| Agentic Reasoning and Tool Integration for LLMs via Reinforcement
  Learning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01441) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.01441))| akshaynambi, akshaynambi, Raghav2002, joykirat | The paper introduces ARTIST (Agentic Reasoning and Tool Integration in Self-improving Transformers), a framework using outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to enable LLMs to autonomously reason and integrate external tools for complex problem-solving. The objective is to enable LLMs to autonomously decide when, how, and which tools to invoke within multi-step reasoning chains, learning robust strategies via RL without step-level supervision. ARTIST trains LLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), interleaving text-based reasoning with tool invocations and outputs, guided by a composite reward function (correctness, format, tool success) and loss masking for tool outputs. ARTIST achieved up to a 22% absolute improvement in mathematical reasoning (e.g., Qwen2.5-14B-ARTIST scored 0.55 Pass@1 on AMC) and more than doubled accuracy on some multi-turn function calling tasks compared to base models. Integrating agentic reasoning with dynamic tool use via outcome-based RL, as in ARTIST, offers a robust path to enhance LLMs for complex tasks requiring external interaction, without needing detailed step-by-step supervision data. |
| SuperEdit: Rectifying and Facilitating Supervision for Instruction-Based
  Image Editing (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02370) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02370))| Xin Gu, Zilence006, lionwen, xiaoying0505, limingcv | SuperEdit introduces a data-oriented method to improve instruction-based image editing by rectifying editing instructions using diffusion priors and facilitating supervision with contrastive learning. The primary objective is to address noisy supervision in instruction-based image editing by developing more effective editing instructions that better align with original-edited image pairs, thereby improving model performance without requiring architectural changes or extensive pre-training. The methodology involves: i) Rectifying editing instructions by guiding a Vision-Language Model (GPT-4O) with diffusion generation priors, which link inference timesteps to specific image attribute changes (global layout, local objects, style/details); and ii) Constructing contrastive supervision signals by generating positive (rectified) and negative (incorrect, subtly altered) instructions from the VLM and training the editing model using a triplet loss. SuperEdit demonstrated a 9.19% performance improvement over the prior state-of-the-art SmartEdit on the Real-Edit benchmark (achieving an Overall Score of 3.91), while utilizing 30x less training data (40K samples) and a 13x smaller model (1.1B parameters). For AI practitioners, this research highlights that significant performance gains in instruction-based image editing can be achieved by focusing on the quality and precision of supervision signals rather than solely on model architecture complexity or extensive pre-training, suggesting a more data-centric and efficient path for model improvement. |
| Low-Precision Training of Large Language Models: Methods, Challenges,
  and Opportunities (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01043) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.01043))| Li Shen, Guoxia, csdvT, GGJY, Zhiwei840 | This survey comprehensively reviews low-precision training techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs), categorizing approaches by numerical formats to address research fragmentation. The primary objective is to systematically organize existing methods—fixed-point/integer-based, floating-point-based, and customized formats—and discuss quantization-aware training (QAT) and system support. The paper reveals an increasing adoption of integer and low-precision floating-point methods, citing an example where FP8-LM achieved a 75% training speedup compared to BF16 for a 175B parameter model.

  Multimodal Interaction (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02471) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02471))| bear-xxy, jianxinsun, chenjingdong, zhengdd0422, BiaoGong | Ming-Lite-Uni is an open-source multimodal framework unifying vision and language through a novel visual generator, multi-scale learnable tokens, and a native autoregressive model for tasks like text-to-image generation and instruction-based editing. The paper aims to demonstrate a unified autoregressive multimodal model built upon multi-scale learnable tokens with fine-tuned diffusion models and to accelerate community engagement by open-sourcing its implementation, improving upon the integrated MetaQueries and M2-omni frameworks. The framework leverages a fixed Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) (Llama3-based M2-omni) and fine-tunes an external diffusion model using newly designed multi-scale learnable query tokens, a multi-scale representation alignment strategy (minimizing Mean Squared Error between DiT backbone intermediate states and final semantic representations), and a FlowMatching loss. Ming-Lite-Uni achieved an overall accuracy of 0.62 on the GenEval benchmark for text-to-image generation, notably scoring 0.99 on single-object generation, and demonstrated strong multimodal understanding with an 80.7 MMB score and 72.3 MM-Vet score. This work provides AI practitioners with an open-source, unified architecture that effectively integrates understanding and generation capabilities, offering a practical foundation for developing advanced multimodal AI systems with robust interactive and generative performance. |
| TEMPURA: Temporal Event Masked Prediction and Understanding for
  Reasoning in Action (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01583) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.01583))| vibhav-vineet, yilche, wchai, hsiangwei0903, andaba | TEMPURA is a two-stage training framework employing masked event prediction and dense captioning, supported by the new VER dataset, to significantly improve temporal event understanding and causal reasoning in video action. The research aims to enhance video Large Multi-modal Models' (LMMs) capability to understand causal event relationships and achieve fine-grained temporal grounding in videos by enabling them to infer missing events and segment videos into detailed, temporally-aligned event descriptions. TEMPURA utilizes a two-stage training pipeline: first, it applies masked event prediction reasoning to reconstruct missing events and generate step-by-step causal explanations from dense event annotations; second, it learns to perform video segmentation and dense captioning to decompose videos into non-overlapping events with detailed, timestamp-aligned descriptions, using the newly curated VER dataset (500K videos, 18K hours). TEMPURA significantly outperforms strong baseline models without task-specific fine-tuning, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 39.2 on the Charades-STA benchmark (a 6.3 point improvement over the baseline) and a HIT@1 score of 51.7 on the QVHighlights dataset (a 6.9 point improvement). This work provides AI engineers and data scientists with a structured two-stage training approach and a large-scale dataset (VER) for developing video LMMs with enhanced abilities to reason about event causality and perform fine-grained temporal segmentation, crucial for applications like highlight detection and detailed video analysis. |
| LLaMA-Omni2: LLM-based Real-time Spoken Chatbot with Autoregressive
  Streaming Speech Synthesis (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02625) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02625))| Yang Feng, Yan Zhou, zhangshaolei, guoshoutao, poeroz | LLaMA-Omni 2 is a series of modular Speech Language Models (0.5B-14B parameters) achieving real-time, high-quality spoken chatbot interaction through an autoregressive streaming speech synthesis pipeline. The main objective is to develop an end-to-end spoken language model capable of real-time, intelligent, and natural speech interaction, addressing limitations of cascaded systems and the extensive data requirements of native SpeechLMs, while retaining strong underlying text capabilities. The system integrates a Whisper speech encoder and adapter with a Qwen2.5 LLM, followed by a streaming speech generation module; this module comprises an autoregressive text-to-speech language model (MTTS), initialized from Qwen2.5-0.5B and utilizing a "Read-R-Write-W" strategy to generate speech tokens, which are then converted to mel spectrograms by a causal flow matching model and HiFi-GAN vocoder, with the entire system fine-tuned on 200K synthesized multi-turn speech dialogues. LLaMA-Omni 2 demonstrates strong performance, with the 7B parameter model achieving 31.3% accuracy on the Web Questions speech-to-speech benchmark, significantly outperforming GLM-4-Voice (15.9%) and exhibiting a latency of 582.91ms for the first speech chunk (using R=3, W=10). The principal implication for AI practitioners is that this modular approach, leveraging pre-trained LLMs with specialized speech components and an efficient streaming architecture, enables the development of high-performance, real-time spoken dialogue systems using substantially less speech-specific training data (200K samples) compared to large native SpeechLMs, offering a more data-efficient pathway. |
| MUSAR: Exploring Multi-Subject Customization from Single-Subject Dataset
  via Attention Routing (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02823) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02823))| Chong Mou, Pengze Zhang, heqian, yanze, Zinan123212 | MUSAR introduces a framework for multi-subject image customization using only single-subject training data via attention routing. The primary objective is to overcome the challenges of acquiring diverse multi-subject training data and mitigating attribute entanglement between subjects in text-to-image generation. MUSAR employs de-biased diptych learning, which constructs multi-subject training pairs from single-subject images and corrects systemic biases using static attention routing and dual-branch LoRA, alongside a dynamic attention routing mechanism that adaptively maps image regions to their corresponding conditional subjects to prevent entanglement. Quantitatively, on DreamBench multi-subject customization, MUSAR achieved a DINO score of 0.704 and a CLIP-I score of 0.720, outperforming methods trained on actual multi-subject datasets. This work provides AI practitioners a data-efficient pathway to develop robust multi-subject customization models without relying on difficult-to-obtain multi-subject datasets, by leveraging synthesized training data and refined attention mechanisms. |
| Learning Heterogeneous Mixture of Scene Experts for Large-scale Neural
  Radiance Fields (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02005) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.02005))| Dan Xu, Xue Xiao, Ping Yin, Zhenxing Mi | This paper introduces Switch-NeRF++, a Heterogeneous Mixture of Hash Experts (HMoHE) framework for efficiently learning decomposition and heterogeneous representations of large-scale Neural Radiance Fields. The main objective is to develop a highly scalable NeRF method that addresses learnable scene decomposition, models scene heterogeneity, and improves modeling efficiency for complex, large-scale scenes in an end-to-end manner. The key methodology involves a hash-based gating network that learns to decompose scenes and allocate 3D points to a set of distinct, heterogeneous hash experts, each designed with different hash grid resolution ranges, all co-optimized within a Sparsely Gated Mixture of Experts (MoE) NeRF framework. Primary results demonstrate state-of-the-art rendering accuracy and significant efficiency improvements; for instance, Switch-NeRF++ achieves an 8x acceleration in training and a 16x acceleration in rendering (e.g., rendering a 1152x864 image in 6.65s versus 110s for Switch-NeRF) compared to the best-performing competitor Switch-NeRF, and outperforms INGP on the UrbanBIS dataset (PSNR 20.76 vs 19.58). The principal implication for AI practitioners is the provision of a more practical and efficient solution for applying NeRFs to real-world, large-scale 3D scene modeling, enabling higher quality and faster reconstruction with reduced computational resources, particularly for scenes with diverse content. |
| Unlearning Sensitive Information in Multimodal LLMs: Benchmark and
  Attack-Defense Evaluation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01456) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.01456))| Jie Peng, Peter Hase, mohitbansal, a2889184, vaidehi99 | This paper introduces UNLOK-VQA, a benchmark, and an attack-defense framework for evaluating targeted unlearning of sensitive information in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The main objective is to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of unlearning methods in MLLMs, particularly for deleting specific multimodal knowledge while preserving model utility. The methodology involves generating the UNLOK-VQA dataset with varied proximity samples for efficacy, generalization, and specificity testing, and an attack-defense framework comprising seven attack types (e.g., a novel Probability Delta2 whitebox attack) against six LoRA-based unlearning defense objectives. Primary results show that multimodal extraction attacks (45.5% success rate against a baseline defense) are more effective than image-only (32%) or text-only (39%) attacks, though the Head Projection (HP) defense significantly reduces multimodal blackbox attack success to 15.7%. For AI practitioners, this research underscores the heightened risk of sensitive information leakage in MLLMs via multimodal inputs and provides a benchmark (UNLOK-VQA) and evidence that specific defense strategies (like HP) are critical for mitigating these vulnerabilities during MLLM development and deployment. |

|-------|---------|---------|
| PixelHacker: Image Inpainting with Structural and Semantic Consistency (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20438) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.20438))| xinggangw, steelozazala, wenyuliu, SmileTAT, Uyoung | PixelHacker introduces Latent Categories Guidance (LCG) within a diffusion model for structurally and semantically consistent image inpainting. The objective is to overcome limitations of existing inpainting methods that struggle with complex structures and semantics, leading to artifacts and logically incoherent results. The key methodology is Latent Categories Guidance (LCG), utilizing separate fixed-size embeddings for latent 'foreground' and 'background' features derived from diverse mask types (semantic, random), injected into a diffusion model's denoising steps via linear attention. PixelHacker demonstrated superior performance, achieving a state-of-the-art FID of 8.59 on the Places2 test set (512 resolution, 40-50% masks), outperforming models like SDXL. For practitioners, the LCG approach demonstrates an effective technique to enhance structural and semantic coherence in diffusion-based inpainting models by conditioning on coarse foreground/background distinctions, rather than complex textual prompts or fine-grained labels, potentially simplifying guidance while improving output quality for image editing applications. |
| Improving Editability in Image Generation with Layer-wise Memory (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01079) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.01079))| Jaesik Park, Jaeah Lee, carpedkm | This paper introduces a framework employing layer-wise memory to improve control and consistency in sequential, mask-guided image editing. The primary objective is to enable multiple edits while preserving background integrity and ensuring natural integration of new elements using only rough user masks, overcoming limitations of single-object editing methods. Key methodologies include a layer-wise memory storing previous edit latents and prompts, Background Consistency Guidance (BCG) for stable background preservation and efficient latent blending, and Multi-Query Disentanglement (MQD) in cross-attention for coherent object integration across layers. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance on a new Multi-Edit Benchmark, achieving a BLEU-4 score of 36.59 and a CLIP score of 64.29, outperforming existing editing and layout-to-image models in sequential tasks. For AI practitioners, this framework offers a robust technique for developing interactive editing systems capable of complex, multi-step modifications with minimal user effort while maintaining high fidelity and contextual coherence. |
| Beyond One-Size-Fits-All: Inversion Learning for Highly Effective NLG
  Evaluation Prompts (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21117) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.21117))| Wenge Rong, Yiqi Liu, Chenghao Xiao, Hanhua Hong, yangwang825 | This paper introduces inversion learning to automatically generate highly effective, model-specific evaluation prompts for NLG systems using just a single evaluation sample. The objective is to overcome the limitations and prompt sensitivity issues inherent in manually crafted prompts used for LLM-based evaluation. The key methodology involves training an inversion model to learn the reverse mapping from an LLM evaluator's output (e.g., human score) back to the corresponding input instruction (evaluation prompt). Results show inversion prompts consistently outperform human-crafted and forward prompts across tasks and models; for LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (Black-Box), inversion prompts achieved a 33% higher average Spearman correlation than forward prompts, demonstrating model-specificity is crucial. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that generating tailored evaluation prompts via inversion learning, instead of using generic ones, leads to more robust, efficient, and reliable LLM-based evaluation. |

Primary results demonstrate the flagship LN-Ultra (253B) achieves state-of-the-art open model performance, outperforming DeepSeek-R1 on benchmarks like GPQA-Diamond (76.0%) while offering significantly higher inference throughput (e.g., 4x at 500/2000 ISL/OSL on 8xH100). For AI practitioners, this provides commercially permissive, high-performance reasoning models optimized for efficient deployment, featuring a novel dynamic reasoning toggle to switch between chat and reasoning modes. |
| CORG: Generating Answers from Complex, Interrelated Contexts (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00023) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.00023))| Trung Bui, aifactoryysh, Franck-Dernoncourt, hyunjilee | This paper introduces CORG, a framework for language models to generate answers from complex corpora by organizing interrelated contexts into processed groups. The objective is to improve language model answer generation accuracy, recall, and disambiguation when processing multiple contexts exhibiting distracting, ambiguous, counterfactual, or duplicated relationships. CORG employs a graph constructor to identify context interrelationships, a reranker to organize contexts into optimized groups based on relationship type, and an aggregator to generate cited answers per group. Results demonstrate CORG's effectiveness; on the AmbigDocs+ dataset with Llama2-7B, CORG achieved a Disambig-F1 score of 22.0, substantially outperforming grouping baselines like KMeans (3.6) and single-pass methods like base processing (17.0). AI practitioners can utilize CORG as an inference-time solution to enhance the robustness of retrieval-augmented generation systems facing inconsistent real-world documents, improving answer quality and entity disambiguation without requiring model retraining. |
| Real-World Gaps in AI Governance Research (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00174) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.00174))| Tim O'Reilly, sruly, isobelmoure, strauss-NYC | This paper analyzes AI safety and reliability research, revealing a corporate focus on pre-deployment and gaps in post-deployment risk analysis. The objective was to compare the research outputs and priorities of leading AI companies (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI) versus top AI universities regarding AI safety and reliability, particularly pre- versus post-deployment issues. Methodology involved analyzing 1,178 safety/reliability papers from 9,439 generative AI papers (Jan 2020-Mar 2025), applying fractional authorship adjustments, classifying papers using GPT-4o mini, and conducting keyword searches for specific risk domains. Primary results indicate corporate research increasingly concentrates on pre-deployment alignment and testing, while only 4% of corporate safety papers address high-risk deployment domains (e.g., misinformation, medical contexts, hallucinations, copyright); ethics and bias research is now predominantly academic. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that current corporate-led research may underemphasize critical risks emerging *after* deployment, necessitating caution as established best practices for real-world operational safety and reliability remain underdeveloped in public research. |
| TeLoGraF: Temporal Logic Planning via Graph-encoded Flow Matching (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00562) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.00562))| Chuchu Fan, yuemithucsd | TeLoGraF introduces a graph-encoded flow matching framework for planning trajectories that satisfy general Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications. The objective is to learn a single conditional generative model capable of handling diverse STL specifications as input without requiring retraining for new formulas. It encodes STL specifications as syntax graphs processed by a Graph Neural Network (GNN) whose embedding conditions a flow-matching model to generate trajectories. Results show TeLoGraF outperforms baselines in STL satisfaction rates across five environments; notably, its "Fast" variant achieves up to 123.6X faster inference than gradient-based methods on the Franka Panda benchmark while maintaining high satisfaction. For AI practitioners, this provides a significantly faster inference method for planning under complex temporal and logical constraints in robotics and cyber-physical systems, though performance degrades on heavily out-of-distribution STLs. |
| X-Cross: Dynamic Integration of Language Models for Cross-Domain
  Sequential Recommendation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20859) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.20859))| Haggai Roitman, liorrokach, Bshapira, yeshel, guyhadad01 | This paper presents X-Cross, a model for cross-domain sequential recommendation via dynamic, layer-wise integration of language models fine-tuned with LoRA. The primary objective is to enable effective sequential recommendation in new target domains by transferring knowledge from multiple source-domain models, requiring minimal target-domain data and avoiding full model retraining. X-Cross utilizes trainable integrators at each layer to dynamically compute weights for combining activations from frozen, LoRA-adapted source domain language models, refining representations progressively. Results show X-Cross achieves performance comparable to target-domain LoRA fine-tuning using only 25% of the adapter parameters, and requires significantly less fine-tuning data (e.g., 83.3% less for Electronics domain adaptation) to surpass baseline performance. For AI practitioners, X-Cross provides a parameter- and data-efficient method for adapting recommendation systems to new domains, reducing computational overhead and data requirements in data-constrained or rapidly evolving environments. |

The primary objective is to improve generation quality and prompt alignment by explicitly coordinating high-level semantic planning (semantic-level CoT) and low-level pixel processing (token-level CoT). The core methodology employs BiCoT-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework that jointly optimizes both CoT levels within a Unified Large Multimodal Model (ULM) using group-relative rewards from an ensemble of vision expert models. T2I-R1 demonstrates superior performance, achieving a 13% improvement over its baseline on T2I-CompBench and surpassing the state-of-the-art FLUX.1 model.

The main objective is to overcome the high inference cost of Long-CoT by tailoring reasoning depth to input problem complexity. Key methodology involves merging long and short CoT models and then applying Bi-Level Preference Training (using DPO) to optimize reasoning path selection at both group (style) and instance (conciseness) levels. Primary results demonstrate a significant reduction in reasoning length (over 50% on average across five math datasets) while largely maintaining accuracy compared to Long-CoT baselines (-1.65% accuracy change with -50.93% length reduction for the 7B model). For AI practitioners, this approach offers a way to deploy powerful reasoning models more efficiently by dynamically allocating computational resources based on task demands, improving feasibility in latency-sensitive or resource-constrained environments. |

  Resolution (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00497) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.00497))| Konstantinos Vougioukas, Michał Stypułkowski, Stella Bounareli, Rodrigo Mira, Antoni Bigata | KeySync introduces a two-stage latent diffusion framework for high-resolution, leakage-free, and occlusion-robust lip synchronization. The research objective is to overcome common lip-sync limitations including temporal inconsistency, expression leakage from source video, and poor occlusion handling, especially in cross-synchronization tasks. Key methodology involves keyframe generation and interpolation via a diffusion model conditioned on audio embeddings and carefully masked video latents, augmented by an inference-time occlusion handling pipeline using video segmentation. KeySync achieves state-of-the-art cross-synchronization performance, notably obtaining a LipScore of 0.48 while significantly reducing expression leakage to a LipLeak score of 0.16, outperforming existing methods quantitatively (Elo: 1145). For AI practitioners, this provides a robust model for high-fidelity applications like automated dubbing, offering temporally coherent output that minimizes leakage and handles occlusions effectively. |

Methodology involved a 6-slot prompt template (character, trait, setting, conflict, resolution, moral) and a hybrid evaluation pipeline combining GPT-based critique with reference-free diversity/readability metrics. Results show Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct achieved the highest composite score (0.891), producing high-quality fables at a cost of approximately $0.135 per 1000 on consumer hardware. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that large-scale, structured narrative datasets for tasks like moral reasoning can be efficiently created using small, open models, reducing reliance on proprietary systems. |
| LLMs for Engineering: Teaching Models to Design High Powered Rockets (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19394) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.19394))| Toby Simonds | This research evaluates Large Language Models' (LLMs) effectiveness in high-powered rocket design, showing reinforcement learning (RL) significantly enhances their capabilities. The study's objective was to determine if LLMs can function as effective tools for physical engineering tasks, using high-powered rocketry as a test domain. Methodology involved creating RocketBench, an interface to the RocketPy simulator, evaluating foundation LLMs (Claude 3.7, o1, etc.) via iterative prompting on altitude and landing tasks, and training a 7B parameter Qwen-2.5 model with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Key results show that while foundation models plateaued below human expert performance (e.g., max human score 76.57 on altitude), the RL-trained 7B model surpassed both humans and foundation models, achieving a peak score of 95.6 on the precision landing task (vs. 91.6 human expert) and landing within 12 meters accuracy. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that integrating RL with LLMs, leveraging their domain knowledge alongside structured exploration, enables performance exceeding human experts in complex engineering optimization, indicating a promising approach for AI-driven design provided effective simulation interfaces and reward functions exist. |

The objective was to systematically assess the performance of MixUp, YOCO, CropMix, CutMix, AugMix, and SnapMix on brain tumor MRI and eye disease fundus datasets to address the domain gap and fragmented prior research. A unified framework applied these augmentations to train and evaluate ResNet-50 and ViT-B models on the two datasets. Results demonstrated significant variability: MixUp achieved the highest accuracy for ResNet-50 on brain tumors (79.19%), while SnapMix was best for ViT-B (99.44%); YOCO (ResNet-50, 91.60%) and CutMix (ViT-B, 97.94%) excelled on eye diseases. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that the optimal mix-based augmentation strategy is highly dependent on the specific combination of backbone architecture (CNN vs. Transformer) and the medical imaging task/dataset. |

| Sadeed: Advancing Arabic Diacritization Through Small Language Model (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21635) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.21635))| Sara Chrouf, hr99, Moatasem444, Hennara, ZeinaD | This paper introduces Sadeed, a compact decoder-only language model fine-tuned for Arabic diacritization, and SadeedDiac-25, a new benchmark for this task. The objective is to advance Arabic diacritization by developing an efficient model trained on high-quality data and establishing a more reliable evaluation framework. Methodology involved fine-tuning the Kuwain 1.5B model on rigorously cleaned Tashkeela and ATB data using a Question-Answering format, alongside creating the SadeedDiac-25 benchmark covering diverse Arabic styles with expert validation. Sadeed achieves competitive results, outperforming open-source models on SadeedDiac-25 (9.92 WER without case ending) and achieving state-of-the-art WER (2.9375 excluding non-diacritized chars) on a corrected version of the Fadel benchmark, though it requires post-processing via Needleman-Wunsch to correct hallucinations. For AI practitioners, this demonstrates the viability of small, specialized models for complex NLP tasks like diacritization and underscores the critical need for high-quality, curated training data and robust, uncontaminated benchmarks, revealing significant flaws in prior commonly used datasets. |

  Models in Math (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21233) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.21233))| Yen-Chun Chen, Dongdong Chen, Hany Awadalla, Baolin Peng, Haoran Xu | This paper introduces a systematic multi-stage training recipe to significantly enhance the mathematical reasoning abilities of small language models (SLMs). The primary objective is to overcome the limitations of SLM capacity and develop robust reasoning capabilities competitive with larger models. The methodology involves four sequential steps: large-scale distilled CoT mid-training, high-quality CoT supervised fine-tuning, Rollout DPO using curated preference pairs, and Reinforcement Learning with a verifiable reward signal incorporating specific stability enhancements. Applying this recipe to the 3.8B Phi-4-Mini model resulted in Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning, achieving 94.6% Pass@1 on Math-500, outperforming larger models like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B. For AI practitioners, this demonstrates that a carefully orchestrated training strategy with high-quality synthetic data can enable resource-constrained SLMs to achieve strong reasoning performance, offering a blueprint for developing efficient and capable models. |
| Softpick: No Attention Sink, No Massive Activations with Rectified
  Softmax (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20966) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.20966))| Alham Fikri Aji, Erland Hilman Fuadi, Zayd M. K. Zuhri | This paper introduces Softpick, a rectified, non-sum-to-one drop-in replacement for softmax in transformer attention mechanisms designed to eliminate attention sinks and massive activations. The main objective is to evaluate if Softpick can maintain performance parity with softmax while mitigating these issues and improving model characteristics like quantization robustness. The methodology involves defining the Softpick function, training 340M parameter Llama-style models from scratch using both Softpick and standard softmax, and comparing their performance on benchmarks, quantization tasks, attention sink rates, activation distributions, and attention map sparsity. Key results show Softpick achieves comparable benchmark performance to softmax, eliminates attention sinks (0% sink rate vs 63.41%), drastically reduces hidden state kurtosis (340 vs 33,510), produces sparser attention maps (46.97% sparsity), and significantly outperforms softmax under quantization, especially at low bit-precisions. For AI practitioners, Softpick presents a viable attention mechanism that intrinsically avoids problematic massive activations, thereby simplifying quantization efforts and potentially enhancing low-precision training and model sparsity. |
| Phi-4-reasoning Technical Report (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21318) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.21318))| Harkirat Behl, Vidhisha Balachandran, Ahmed Awadallah, Sahaj Agarwal, Marah Abdin | This report introduces Phi-4-reasoning and Phi-4-reasoning-plus, 14-billion parameter models optimized for complex reasoning tasks via specialized training. The objective is to detail the models' creation through data curation, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL), and evaluate their reasoning performance. Key methodologies include SFT of Phi-4 on curated prompts with o3-mini-generated reasoning traces for Phi-4-reasoning, followed by outcome-based RL on math problems for Phi-4-reasoning-plus. Primary results show both models significantly outperform larger open-weight models like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B (e.g., Phi-4-reasoning-plus achieves 78.0% on AIME 25 vs. 51.5%) and approach state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating substantial gains over the base Phi-4. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that meticulous data curation for SFT combined with targeted RL can yield highly capable reasoning models at smaller scales, rivaling significantly larger architectures. |
| Beyond the Last Answer: Your Reasoning Trace Uncovers More than You
  Think (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20708) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.20708))| Bernard Ghanem, Hani Itani, Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud | This research demonstrates that analyzing intermediate reasoning steps ("subthoughts") in LLMs yields more reliable answers than relying solely on the final output. The study investigates whether an LLM's final answer is its optimal conclusion and if alternative reasoning paths from intermediate points yield different results. Methodologically, it segments an initial reasoning trace, prompts the model to generate completions from each intermediate subthought endpoint, extracts the final numerical answer from each completion, and analyzes the resulting distribution of answers. The primary result shows that selecting the most frequent answer (mode) from these completions significantly boosts accuracy compared to the original final answer, with gains up to 13% on AIME2024, and that lower answer distribution entropy correlates with correctness. For AI practitioners, this implies that evaluating the distribution of answers derived from subthoughts, particularly using the mode, offers a more robust method for assessing LLM reasoning reliability than standard final-answer evaluation. |
| Taming the Titans: A Survey of Efficient LLM Inference Serving (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19720) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.19720))| Tong Liu, Zhenlin Yang, Yixin Ji, Juntao Li, zenRRan | This paper surveys methods for optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference serving efficiency. The objective is to provide a comprehensive, hierarchical overview of techniques addressing the memory and computational challenges in LLM deployment. The methodology involves systematically reviewing and categorizing research into instance-level (e.g., model placement, KV cache management, request scheduling, PD disaggregation), cluster-level (e.g., deployment, load balancing, cloud), emerging scenarios (e.g., long context, RAG, MoE), and miscellaneous areas. The survey organizes numerous optimization strategies, highlighting advancements like PagedAttention for KV cache memory fragmentation and Prefill-Decoding (PD) disaggregation for optimizing distinct inference phases, though specific quantitative performance improvements across all methods aren't aggregated due to the survey nature. For AI practitioners, this survey offers a structured map of optimization techniques, aiding in the selection and implementation of appropriate strategies to meet specific latency, throughput, and cost requirements for LLM serving. |
| COMPACT: COMPositional Atomic-to-Complex Visual Capability Tuning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21850) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.21850))| Olga Russakovsky, Polina Kirichenko, Hee Seung Hwang, Xindi Wu | This paper introduces COMPACT, a data-efficient visual instruction tuning recipe to improve compositional reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by explicitly combining atomic visual skills. The main objective is to enhance MLLM performance on complex visual tasks requiring multiple capabilities without massive data scaling, addressing the lack compositional complexity in existing VIT datasets. COMPACT's methodology involves defining 10 atomic capabilities, generating structured training data by prompting a generator model (Gemini-2.0-Flash) to create questions integrating exactly k={1, 2, 3} capabilities for sampled images, verifying quality, and mixing this data (32K samples) with 5% of LLaVA-665K VIT data. Primary results show COMPACT achieves performance comparable to the full LLaVA-665K baseline using less than 10% of the data, and significantly improves performance on complex tasks, achieving an 83.3% improvement on MMStar benchmark questions requiring four or more atomic capabilities. For AI practitioners, this implies that focusing on structured, compositionally complex training data generation offers a more data-efficient path to enhancing MLLM reasoning on complex multi-capability tasks compared to solely scaling undifferentiated instruction tuning data. |

The primary objective is to overcome robotics' challenges in data scaling and standardized evaluation by unifying diverse simulation environments and datasets. Key methodology involves METASIM, an infrastructure that abstracts simulators (like Isaac Sim, MuJoCo) via a universal configuration system and API, enabling cross-simulator integration, hybrid simulation, large-scale data migration, and augmentation. Experiments demonstrate that RoboVerse improves imitation learning (e.g., ACT achieved 50.0% average success on representative tasks), reinforcement learning, and world models, facilitating direct sim-to-real transfer (e.g., OpenVLA achieved 7.0/10.0 on a real-world wash soap task after sim training). For AI practitioners, RoboVerse provides a standardized framework and a large, diverse synthetic dataset to train and evaluate robot learning models more efficiently, potentially accelerating development and improving sim-to-real generalization. |
| ReVision: High-Quality, Low-Cost Video Generation with Explicit 3D
  Physics Modeling for Complex Motion and Interaction (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21855) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.21855))| Alan Yuille, Liang-Chieh Chen, Qihang Yu, Ju He, Qihao Liu | ReVision enhances pre-trained video diffusion models by explicitly integrating parameterized 3D physical knowledge for high-quality, controllable generation of complex motion and interaction. The objective is to improve video generation quality, motion consistency, and control, particularly for complex actions and interactions, by leveraging 3D physical priors without needing massive models. The methodology involves a three-stage "Extract-Optimize-Reinforce" pipeline: generating a coarse video, extracting/optimizing 3D features using a Parameterized Physical Prior Model (PPPM), and regenerating the video conditioned on the refined 3D motion. Applied to Stable Video Diffusion (1.5B parameters), ReVision significantly improves motion coherence, outperforming a 13B parameter model in user preference studies and achieving an FVD of 130.14 on dance generation, adding only 5 seconds to inference time. For AI practitioners, this demonstrates that incorporating explicit physical knowledge can enhance smaller models to generate complex, controllable, physically plausible motions, offering an alternative to massive parameter scaling. |

The main objective was to enhance LLM performance on specialized cybersecurity tasks by addressing domain-specific data scarcity and knowledge representation challenges. Key methodology involved collecting and filtering web data for cybersecurity relevance, performing continued pretraining, and evaluating the model on benchmarks like CTIBench, CyberMetric, and SecBench using few-shot or zero-shot prompting. Foundation-Sec-8B demonstrated significant improvement over the base Llama 3.1-8B, notably achieving 14.29% higher accuracy (0.720±0.017) on the CTIBench-RCM task, matching or exceeding larger models like Llama 3.1-70B and GPT-4o-mini in specific CTI evaluations while showing minimal general knowledge degradation.

## Papers for 2025-04-30

| Title | Authors | Summary |
|-------|---------|---------|
| UniversalRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation over Multiple Corpora with
  Diverse Modalities and Granularities (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20734) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.20734))| Sung Ju Hwang, Soyeong Jeong, jinheon, KangsanKim71, wgcyeo | UniversalRAG introduces a retrieval-augmented generation framework handling diverse modalities and granularities by routing queries to modality-specific corpora. The main objective is to address the limitation of existing RAG systems, which typically handle only single modalities or suffer from modality gaps when unifying heterogeneous corpora. The key methodology involves a modality-aware router (either training-free using GPT-4o or trained using models like T5) that dynamically selects the optimal corpus (text, image, video) and granularity (e.g., paragraph, document, clip) for retrieval, avoiding direct cross-modal comparison in a unified space. Across 8 benchmarks using the InternVL-2.5 model, UniversalRAG with a T5-Large trained router achieved a 39.36 average score, significantly outperforming a unified corpus baseline (31.15), demonstrating the effectiveness of modality-specific routing. For AI practitioners, this implies that dynamically routing queries to specialized, modality-specific corpora, rather than relying on a single unified multimodal index, is crucial for building robust RAG systems that accurately leverage heterogeneous knowledge sources. |
| Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning in Large Language Models with One
  Training Example (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20571) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.20571))| Baolin, renll, ZhiyuanZeng, hushqyang, ypwang61 | This paper demonstrates that Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) using just one training example (1-shot RLVR) can dramatically enhance LLM mathematical reasoning. The main objective was to investigate the extent to which the RLVR training dataset size can be reduced while maintaining performance comparable to using large datasets. The key methodology involved applying RL algorithms, primarily GRPO, to LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B) using a single math problem-answer pair, duplicated to form the training batch. Primary results show that a carefully selected single example improved the Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B model's performance on MATH500 from 36.0% to 73.6%, matching the performance obtained using a 1.2k example dataset. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that substantial reasoning improvements may be achievable with extreme data efficiency using RLVR, suggesting base models possess strong latent capabilities that can be activated by minimal, targeted RL signals, potentially reducing the need for extensive data curation. |
| ReasonIR: Training Retrievers for Reasoning Tasks (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20595) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.20595))| pangwei, sewon, Muennighoff, volpato30, rulins | ReasonIR-8B is a novel bi-encoder retriever trained specifically for reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks using a synthetic data generation pipeline. The main objective is to improve retrieval quality for complex reasoning queries where existing fact-focused training data and retrievers show limited gains. The key methodology involves REASONIR-SYNTHESIZER, a pipeline generating challenging synthetic data including varied-length queries, reasoning-intensive hard queries, and corresponding plausible hard negatives from seed documents, used for contrastive training of a Llama3.1-8B model. REASONIR-8B achieved a new state-of-the-art 29.9 nDCG@10 on the BRIGHT benchmark without reranking, outperforming existing retrievers and improving downstream RAG task performance on MMLU by 6.4% over the closed-book baseline. For AI practitioners, this work provides a method (REASONIR-SYNTHESIZER) and a trained model (REASONIR-8B) to enhance RAG systems needing to retrieve diverse, contextually relevant information for complex reasoning, rather than just direct factual answers. |
| Toward Evaluative Thinking: Meta Policy Optimization with Evolving
  Reward Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20157) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.20157))| Chanwoo Park, dykang, machineteacher, zaemyung | Meta Policy Optimization (MPO) introduces a meta-reward model to dynamically refine evaluation rubrics during reinforcement learning alignment for LLMs. The main objective is to mitigate reward hacking and reduce the prompt engineering overhead associated with static reward models in RLAIF. The key methodology involves using a meta-reward model (MRM) to monitor the training context (policy outputs, reward scores, current rubric) and iteratively update the reward model's (RM) evaluation prompt via meta-analysis, meta-refinement, and meta-merging steps during PPO training. Primary results demonstrate that MPO-aligned models consistently outperform static-prompt PPO baselines across tasks; for instance, on essay writing, the 32B RM + 32B MRM configuration achieved an Elo rating of 1196, significantly higher than the 966 Elo of the PPO baseline using the initial prompt. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that MPO provides a framework for automating the development of effective evaluation rubrics and enhancing alignment stability, reducing reliance on brittle, manually engineered prompts and mitigating risks of reward hacking. |
| TesserAct: Learning 4D Embodied World Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20995) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.20995))| Junyan Li, Hongxin Zhang, Qiao Sun, yilundu, anyeZHY | TesserAct introduces a 4D embodied world model learned from RGB, Depth, and Normal (RGB-DN) videos to predict 3D scene evolution based on text instructions. The objective is to create a model generating temporally and spatially consistent 4D scene predictions for embodied agent actions, surpassing traditional 2D world models. Key methodology involves fine-tuning a video diffusion model on a curated RGB-DN dataset for joint prediction and using a novel algorithm with consistency/regularization losses to reconstruct coherent 4D point clouds from generated videos. TesserAct achieves superior 4D reconstruction quality, evidenced by a Chamfer L1 distance of 0.0811 on synthetic data (lower is better), and improves downstream robotic task success rates (e.g., 88% vs 81% for UniPi* on 'close box'). For AI practitioners, this provides a framework for building geometrically accurate world models from multi-modal video, enabling enhanced simulation, planning, and policy learning for robotics compared to video-only approaches. |
| YoChameleon: Personalized Vision and Language Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20998) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.20998))| Jing Shi, Krishna Kumar Singh, Thao Nguyen, Yuheng, yjlee0222 | Yo'Chameleon personalizes Large Multimodal Models for joint vision and language generation using few-shot concept images. The primary objective is to enable LMMs to understand and generate content about specific user concepts provided via only 3-5 images, addressing the limitation of generic models. The methodology utilizes dual soft prompts (for understanding and generation) tuned via a self-prompting mechanism for task selection, combined with a "soft-positive" image training strategy using adaptive prompt lengths based on visual similarity. Results demonstrate superior performance over prompting baselines, achieving a recognition accuracy of 0.845 (vs. 0.727 baseline) and a CLIP image similarity of 0.783 (vs. 0.566 baseline) for generation using only 32 learnable tokens, while preserving general model capabilities. For AI practitioners, this provides a parameter-efficient method to infuse personalized knowledge into LMMs using minimal user data, enabling tailored multimodal generation and understanding without requiring full model retraining or suffering significant catastrophic forgetting. |
| The Leaderboard Illusion (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20879) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.20879))| sayashk, dsouzadaniel, AlexWang, olivernan, shivalikasingh | This research reveals systematic distortions in Chatbot Arena rankings caused by undisclosed private testing, selective score reporting, and significant data access disparities favoring proprietary models. The objective was to investigate whether Chatbot Arena rankings accurately reflect generative AI model capabilities or are skewed by preferential evaluation policies and practices. Methodology involved auditing 243 models from 42 providers using ~2M battle records (Jan 2024 - Apr 2025), combining public data, scraped statistics, proprietary API data, simulations, and real-world private variant experiments. Primary results show undisclosed private testing benefits select providers (e.g., Meta tested 27 private variants pre-Llama 4 release), enabling selective score reporting; proprietary models receive disproportionately more data (Google/OpenAI ~20% each vs. 83 open-weight models combined ~30%); and access to Arena data provides substantial performance gains (up to 112% relative win-rate increase on ArenaHard). For AI practitioners, this implies that Chatbot Arena rankings may significantly reflect leaderboard-specific dynamics and overfitting due to unequal data access and private testing advantages, rather than solely general model competence, potentially misguiding model development and selection. |
| Certified Mitigation of Worst-Case LLM Copyright Infringement (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16046) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.16046))| Daniel Khashabi, Benjamin Van Durme, Jiacan Yu, mmarone, jackzhang | This paper introduces BLOOMSCRUB, an inference-time method for certified mitigation of worst-case copyright infringement in LLMs by removing long verbatim quotes. The primary objective is to prevent LLMs from generating long verbatim excerpts (worst-case infringement) from copyrighted corpora while preserving text utility and factual knowledge. The key methodology involves iteratively applying a Bloom filter for efficient detection of verbatim quotes exceeding a length threshold (τ) and using an LLM to perform guided rewriting ("scrubbing") of the detected segments, with an option to abstain if removal fails. Experimental results demonstrate BLOOMSCRUB effectively reduces worst-case infringement, achieving near-zero generation of quotes longer than 100 characters (%R > Q(100) ≈ 0.0%) compared to ~20% in vanilla models, while maintaining information quality and utility. For AI practitioners, BLOOMSCRUB offers a scalable, plug-and-play, inference-only technique to demonstrably reduce the risk of generating infringing long verbatim text, adaptable to different risk thresholds without requiring model retraining or access to logits. |
| ISDrama: Immersive Spatial Drama Generation through Multimodal Prompting (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20630) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.20630))| Tao Jin, Zhiyuan Zhu, Changhao Pan, Wenxiang Guo, AaronZ345 | ISDrama introduces a unified framework for generating continuous, multi-speaker binaural speech with dramatic prosody from multimodal prompts for immersive spatial drama applications. The research objective is to simultaneously model complex spatial audio cues (position, orientation, movement, Doppler effect) and dramatic prosody from diverse inputs (scripts, audio, video, poses), overcoming data scarcity and integration challenges. Key methodology includes the creation of the MRSDrama dataset and the ISDrama model, featuring a contrastive learning-based Multimodal Pose Encoder for unified pose features and a flow-based Mamba-Transformer (Immersive Drama Transformer) with Drama-MOE and context-consistent CFG for generation. Primary results show ISDrama outperforms baselines, achieving superior prosodic expressiveness (MOS-E 4.01 ± 0.09 vs. 3.86 ± 0.06 for F5-TTS) and better spatial consistency (MOS-P 4.18 ± 0.10 for geometric input). The principal implication for AI practitioners is the availability of a one-stage solution for generating high-fidelity, spatially accurate, and dramatically expressive binaural speech directly from multimodal sources, avoiding error accumulation typical of cascaded approaches and enhancing immersive VR/AR experiences. |
| X-Fusion: Introducing New Modality to Frozen Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20996) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.20996))| Yijun Li, Siddharth Srinivasan Iyer, Xun Huang, Thao Nguyen, Sicheng Mo | X-Fusion introduces a framework for adding vision capabilities to frozen Large Language Models (LLMs) while preserving their text abilities. The primary objective is to develop an efficient method for unified multimodal understanding and generation without retraining the LLM from scratch or degrading its inherent language skills. The key methodology involves a Dual Tower architecture where the original LLM (text tower) is frozen, and a parallel, trainable vision tower processes visual information, with selective feature integration across layers. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over alternative architectures, with the Dual Tower design achieving a 23% lower (better) FID score (14.20 vs 19.10) on text-to-image generation compared to a single-tower fine-tuning approach using a 1B parameter model. For AI practitioners, this work presents a computationally efficient strategy to extend powerful LLMs to multimodal domains, suggesting that modality-specific towers can effectively integrate new capabilities without compromising the core model's pretrained knowledge. |
| Disentangle Identity, Cooperate Emotion: Correlation-Aware Emotional
  Talking Portrait Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18087) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.18087))| Xiaobin Hu, FeiFan Xu, Chuming Lin, Weipeng Tan, ChengmingX | DICE-Talk introduces a diffusion-based framework for generating emotionally expressive talking portraits while preserving identity by disentangling emotion/identity and leveraging inter-emotion correlations. The primary objective is to develop an emotional talking head generation model that overcomes limitations such as insufficient audio emotion utilization, identity leakage into emotion representations, and isolated emotion learning. Key methodologies include a cross-modal disentangled emotion embedder modeling emotions as identity-agnostic Gaussian distributions, a correlation-enhanced conditioning module using a learnable emotion bank, and an emotion discrimination objective during diffusion. DICE-Talk significantly outperforms prior methods in emotion accuracy, achieving a top Emo-Score of 0.4865 on MEAD and 0.5527 on an out-of-domain dataset, while maintaining competitive lip-sync and visual quality. AI practitioners can utilize this framework's disentangled audio-visual emotion modeling and correlation-aware conditioning via emotion banks to create more controllable, realistic, and emotionally expressive digital avatars for applications requiring nuanced human interaction. |
| TreeHop: Generate and Filter Next Query Embeddings Efficiently for
  Multi-hop Question Answering (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20114) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.20114))| Xuming Hu, Shuliang Liu, Jinghuai Ou, Zhonghao Li, kpzhang1028 | TreeHop introduces an efficient, embedding-level iterative retrieval framework for multi-hop question answering that bypasses LLM-based query rewriting. The main objective is to significantly reduce computational overhead and latency in multi-hop RAG systems compared to methods requiring iterative LLM calls, while preserving retrieval effectiveness. Key methodology involves dynamically generating next-step query embeddings by fusing prior query and retrieved document embeddings using a gated cross-attention mechanism (UpdateGate) and rule-based pruning strategies. Primary results demonstrate comparable recall performance to advanced RAG systems on three MHQA benchmarks but with approximately 99% lower query latency (e.g., achieving 61.6% Recall@5 on 2WikiMultiHop iter2 with 0.022s latency versus 59.2% recall and 4.690s latency for Iter-RetGen). For AI practitioners, TreeHop presents a substantially faster and more cost-effective approach for implementing multi-hop RAG, replacing computationally expensive iterative LLM query refinements with lightweight embedding-space operations. |


## Papers for 2025-04-29

| Title | Authors | Summary |
|-------|---------|---------|
| RepText: Rendering Visual Text via Replicating (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19724) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.19724))| Yimeng Li, winhelp, SNOWAI, YujiaX, wanghaofan | RepText introduces a method for rendering multilingual visual text in images by replicating glyphs rather than relying on deep text understanding. The main objective is to empower pre-trained monolingual text-to-image models with accurate, controllable multilingual text rendering capabilities without costly retraining or multilingual encoders. The key methodology involves a ControlNet-like architecture conditioned on language-agnostic glyph canny edges and position masks, enhanced by a text perceptual (OCR) loss, glyph latent replication during initialization, and regional masking at inference. Results show RepText outperforms existing open-source methods and achieves comparable performance to native multilingual closed-source models in rendering quality and accuracy, though specific quantitative metrics are not provided in the initial sections. For AI practitioners, this implies the ability to add precise, user-specified multilingual text to images using existing monolingual generative models through glyph replication, bypassing the need for models with inherent multilingual text understanding. |
| LLM-Powered GUI Agents in Phone Automation: Surveying Progress and
  Prospects (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19838) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.19838))| Afeng-x, guoyaxuan0106, melpancake, Pengxiangzhao, guangyil | This paper systematically reviews the evolution and capabilities of LLM-powered phone GUI agents, contrasting them with traditional methods. The main objective is to survey the progress, analyze core technologies, identify challenges, and outline future prospects for LLMs in phone automation. The methodology involves a comprehensive literature review, proposing a taxonomy of agent frameworks (single-agent, multi-agent, plan-then-act), modeling approaches (prompting, training-based), datasets, and benchmarks, alongside analyzing how LLMs address prior limitations. Primary results indicate LLMs significantly enhance phone automation through advanced language understanding, multimodal perception, and decision-making, overcoming traditional script limitations; for instance, specific RL approaches like DistRL show up to 20% relative improvement in success rate over state-of-the-art methods on general Android tasks. For AI practitioners, this survey provides a structured taxonomy and methodological framework, serving as a definitive reference for designing, developing, and evaluating scalable, adaptive LLM-powered phone GUI agents. |
| CipherBank: Exploring the Boundary of LLM Reasoning Capabilities through
  Cryptography Challenges (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19093) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.19093))| JiangWu, mingchenlin2025, LHL3341, blue01223, yu0226 | This paper introduces CipherBank, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating LLM reasoning on cryptographic decryption tasks. The main objective is to rigorously assess the cryptographic reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs, identifying their strengths and weaknesses in this specific domain. Key methodology involves evaluating 18 state-of-the-art LLMs on the CipherBank dataset (comprising 2,358 problems across 5 domains, 14 subdomains, and 9 encryption algorithms) using a 3-shot known-plaintext attack evaluation protocol and accuracy metrics. Primary results reveal significant limitations across all models, even advanced ones; the top-performing model, Claude-3.5, achieved only 45.14% accuracy, demonstrating that current reasoning optimizations inadequately address cryptographic challenges. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that standard LLMs exhibit poor performance in precise cryptographic manipulation, indicating unsuitability for security-critical applications and highlighting the need for targeted development of symbolic reasoning and rule application capabilities beyond general language understanding for robust AI systems. |
| Clinical knowledge in LLMs does not translate to human interactions (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18919) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.18919))| cynddl, sahimo, Chronoszoldyck11, HannahRoseKirk, ambean | Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate high clinical knowledge on benchmarks but fail to improve lay users' medical assessment accuracy in realistic interactive scenarios compared to controls. The study investigated whether providing laypeople with access to high-performing LLMs (GPT-4o, Llama 3, Command R+) improves their ability to identify appropriate medical dispositions and relevant conditions in simulated health scenarios. A randomized controlled trial (N=1298) assigned participants to receive assistance from one of three LLMs or a control group (using typical resources) to assess ten medical vignettes against physician-defined gold standards. While LLMs alone identified relevant conditions in over 90% of cases, participants using LLMs identified relevant conditions in less than 34.5% of cases, significantly underperforming the control group (47.0%, p<0.001), and showed no significant improvement in disposition accuracy. For AI practitioners, this study critically demonstrates that strong performance on static or simulated benchmarks does not predict real-world interactive utility; robust human-user testing focused on interaction dynamics is essential before deploying LLMs for public health applications. |
| Group Downsampling with Equivariant Anti-aliasing (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17258) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.17258))| Raymond A. Yeh, ashiq24 | This paper introduces a method for uniform downsampling of signals on finite groups with equivariant anti-aliasing, generalizing classical sampling theory concepts for group equivariant architectures. The objective is to define how to select an appropriate subgroup for a given downsampling rate and how to perform anti-aliasing to preserve equivariance. The methodology involves an algorithm for subgroup selection based on Cayley graphs, a Subgroup Sampling Theorem defining bandlimited-ness for perfect reconstruction, and an equivariant anti-aliasing operator derived via constrained optimization. Experiments demonstrate improved accuracy and equivariance (e.g., near-zero reconstruction error like 1.72e-13 for bandlimited signals on D28 downsampled to D14) and reduced model size when incorporated into G-CNNs for image classification. For AI practitioners, this provides a principled way to incorporate downsampling into group equivariant networks, enabling more computationally efficient models while better preserving theoretical equivariance guarantees compared to naive subsampling. |
| TrustGeoGen: Scalable and Formal-Verified Data Engine for Trustworthy
  Multi-modal Geometric Problem Solving (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15780) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.15780))| BoZhang, friskit, Rethinker, zhoubb2010, renqiux0302 | TrustGeoGen is a scalable engine generating formally verified multimodal geometric problems, solutions, and diagrams. The objective is to create a reliable benchmark and data generation pipeline for trustworthy geometric problem solving (GPS), addressing the lack of verified, multimodal data. Its methodology integrates multimodal-aligned generation, formal logical verification of reasoning steps, a bootstrapping mechanism for complexity scaling, and algorithms for generating diverse, traceable solutions. Primary results show the generated GeoTrust-test is challenging for SOTA models (OpenAI-o1 achieves 49.17% accuracy), and training on GeoTrust data improves OOD generalization on GeoQA compared to pseudo-labels. For AI practitioners, this provides a formally verified data source and engine (TrustGeoGen/GeoTrust) crucial for developing and evaluating more logically sound multimodal geometric reasoning systems, demonstrating superior training effectiveness over unverified data. |
| SPC: Evolving Self-Play Critic via Adversarial Games for LLM Reasoning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19162) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.19162))| Xiaodan Liang, Peisong Wang, Bang Zhang, vvibt, judge | This paper introduces Self-Play Critic (SPC), a method to automatically evolve a critic model for assessing LLM reasoning steps via adversarial self-play, removing the need for manual step-level annotation. The main objective is to improve the evaluation of step-by-step reliability in complex LLM reasoning like Chain-of-Thought. SPC employs two fine-tuned models, a "sneaky generator" creating subtle errors and a "critic" detecting them, which improve iteratively through reinforcement learning based on adversarial game outcomes. Experiments show SPC progressively enhances error detection capabilities (accuracy increasing from 70.8% to 77.7% on ProcessBench) and significantly improves LLM mathematical reasoning on MATH500 and AIME2024 when used to guide test-time search, outperforming existing process reward models. For AI practitioners, SPC provides a scalable technique to develop more accurate step-level critics for verifying and enhancing LLM reasoning processes without requiring expensive human-labeled data. |
| Benchmarking Multimodal Mathematical Reasoning with Explicit Visual
  Dependency (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18589) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.18589))| Xin Li, Zhiqiang Hu, Wenqi Zhang, Jiashuo Sun, cloudcatcher2 | VCBENCH is a new benchmark evaluating Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on elementary math problems requiring reasoning across multiple images with explicit visual dependencies. The objective is to assess the core ability of LVLMs to discern, integrate, and reason using visual information from multiple images for basic mathematical tasks, moving beyond knowledge-centric evaluations. The methodology involved creating VCBENCH with 1,720 problems (averaging 3.9 images each, total 6,697 images) across six cognitive domains and evaluating 26 state-of-the-art LVLMs. Primary results show significant performance limitations, with even the best-performing models (e.g., Gemini2.0-Flash, Qwen-VL-Max) failing to exceed 50% accuracy, indicating particular weaknesses in pattern recognition and integrating visual cues across multiple images. For AI practitioners, this highlights a critical gap in current LVLMs' fundamental visual-mathematical reasoning and multi-image integration capabilities, suggesting that model architectures and pre-training strategies need substantial improvement for tasks requiring grounded visual reasoning beyond single-image comprehension. |
| MMInference: Accelerating Pre-filling for Long-Context VLMs via
  Modality-Aware Permutation Sparse Attention (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16083) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.16083))| Xufang Luo, Qianhui Wu, Chengruidong Zhang, Yucheng Li, iofu728 | MMInference introduces a dynamic sparse attention method to accelerate the pre-filling stage for long-context Vision Language Models (VLMs). The primary objective is to mitigate the quadratic complexity bottleneck of attention during the processing of long multi-modal inputs, particularly the pre-fill stage which causes high Time-to-First-Token latency. The key methodology involves identifying unique modality-specific sparse patterns (like the Grid pattern for visual data) and modality boundaries, then applying modality-aware permutations and optimized GPU kernels for efficient sparse computation without model modification. Experiments demonstrate that MMInference accelerates the pre-filling stage by up to 8.3x for 1M tokens compared to dense attention, while maintaining comparable accuracy on various multi-modal benchmarks using models like LongVila and Llava-Video. For AI practitioners, this offers a drop-in method to significantly reduce inference latency for long-context VLMs, enabling faster deployment in real-world applications without requiring model fine-tuning. |
| ICL CIPHERS: Quantifying "Learning'' in In-Context Learning via
  Substitution Ciphers (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19395) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.19395))| Daniel Khashabi, Anqi Liu, Muhan Gao, Aayush Mishra, FocusV857 | This paper introduces ICL CIPHERS, using substitution ciphers to quantify task learning (TL) in In-Context Learning (ICL) separately from task retrieval (TR). The main objective is to determine if Large Language Models (LLMs) can decipher and solve tasks when input tokens are systematically replaced using a reversible (bijective) mapping, thereby measuring inference-time learning. The methodology involves comparing LLM accuracy on tasks using inputs ciphered with bijective substitution mappings versus non-bijective (irreversible, random) mappings across four datasets and six models. Results consistently show LLMs perform better on bijective ciphers; Llama3.1 (8B) achieved an average of 7.1% higher accuracy on the bijective ciphered Amazon dataset compared to the non-bijective cipher across various demonstration counts. For AI practitioners, the observed accuracy gap between bijective and non-bijective ciphered tasks provides a quantitative proxy to assess an LLM's ability to learn novel, reversible patterns during inference, beyond simple retrieval from pre-training data. |
| ChiseLLM: Unleashing the Power of Reasoning LLMs for Chisel Agile
  Hardware Development (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19144) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.19144))| Shanshan Li, Renzhi Chen, Jiaran Gao, xiuranli, observerw | This paper introduces ChiseLLM, a series of datasets and fine-tuned reasoning models to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) performance for Chisel hardware construction language generation. The research objective is to address the poor syntax correctness and limited design variability exhibited by existing LLMs when generating Chisel code for Agile Hardware Development Methodology (AHDM). Methodologically, the authors curated high-quality datasets from public RTL sources, synthesized prompt-guided reasoning traces, and performed domain-adapted fine-tuning on Qwen2.5-Coder base models. Results show significant improvements; notably, the ChiseLLM-32B model increased average Pass@5 syntax correctness by 26.32% over the base model and boosted design variability capability by 47.58% compared to baseline reasoning models. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that domain adaptation combined with synthesized reasoning traces is crucial for effectively leveraging reasoning LLMs in specialized, low-resource code generation tasks like HCL, enabling practical application in hardware design. |


## Papers for 2025-04-28

|-------|---------|---------|
| Towards Understanding Camera Motions in Any Video (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15376) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.15376))| Jay Karhade, Daniel Jiang, Stephen624, syCen, zhiqiulin | Introduces CameraBench, a large-scale dataset and benchmark for understanding camera motion primitives in diverse internet videos. The main objective is to evaluate how well current Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Video-Language Models (VLMs) understand a comprehensive taxonomy of camera motions and to improve this capability. Methodology involves creating a detailed taxonomy with cinematographers, collecting and annotating ~3,000 videos, conducting human studies, and benchmarking 20 diverse models (SfM/SLAM and VLMs) on tasks like classification, VQA, captioning, and retrieval. Primary results show classic SfM struggles with semantic/dynamic content, while VLMs struggle with precise geometry; the best baseline method (MegaSAM) achieves ~50% overall Average Precision (AP) on primitive classification, while fine-tuning a generative VLM (Qwen2.5-VL-7B) boosts performance significantly (~2x improvement), reaching 59.3% AP. AI practitioners can utilize CameraBench's dataset and taxonomy to fine-tune VLMs, substantially improving their ability to interpret both geometric and semantic camera movements for enhanced video understanding applications. |

The primary objective is to enhance sophisticated reasoning capabilities in vision-language models (VLMs) while preserving broad generalization, directly addressing the challenge of balancing these competing demands via reinforcement learning. Methodologically, R1V2 combines Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO) with reward-model guidance and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), augmented by a Selective Sample Buffer (SSB) to counteract vanishing advantages and prioritize informative training samples. Key results demonstrate state-of-the-art open-source performance, achieving 78.9% on AIME2024 and 62.6% on OlympiadBench, significantly improving upon prior open-source models and reducing the gap with proprietary systems. For AI practitioners, this work presents a validated hybrid RL framework (MPO+GRPO+SSB) as an effective technique for building capable multimodal reasoning models without reliance on SFT, while highlighting the necessity of careful reward calibration to manage the trade-off between enhanced reasoning and potential visual hallucination. |
| BitNet v2: Native 4-bit Activations with Hadamard Transformation for
  1-bit LLMs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18415) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.18415))| Furu Wei, Shuming Ma, Hongyu Wang | BitNet v2 introduces a framework for 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs) enabling native 4-bit activation quantization. The main objective is to overcome activation outliers that complicate low bit-width quantization in attention and feed-forward networks. Key methodology involves H-BitLinear, which applies an online Hadamard transformation to reshape activation distributions into more Gaussian-like forms prior to quantization, specifically targeting attention output (Wo) and FFN down-projection (Wdown). Experiments show BitNet v2 trained with native 4-bit activations achieves performance comparable to prior versions using 8-bit or hybrid activations; for instance, the 7B model BitNet v2 (a4) achieves an average downstream task accuracy of 58.30, close to BitNet b1.58's 58.12. For AI practitioners, this research offers a viable path towards deploying 1-bit LLMs with efficient native 4-bit activations, reducing memory and computational costs, particularly beneficial for hardware supporting low-bit computations and batched inference scenarios. |
| VideoVista-CulturalLingo: 360^circ Horizons-Bridging Cultures,
  Languages, and Domains in Video Comprehension (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17821) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.17821))| Wenhan Luo, Baotian Hu, Haoyuan Shi, Yunxin Li, Xinyu Chen | VideoVista-CulturalLingo introduces the first benchmark for evaluating video comprehension across diverse cultures (Chinese, Western), languages (Chinese, English), and domains. The primary objective is to assess the understanding and reasoning capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs) beyond existing culturally and linguistically limited benchmarks. A dataset comprising 1,389 videos and 3,134 QA pairs was constructed using a hybrid annotation framework leveraging LLMs (Qwen2-VL, DeepSeek) and human review, followed by the evaluation of 24 LMMs. Experimental results indicate proprietary models like Gemini-2.0-Flash achieve the highest accuracy (76.3%), while open-source models show limitations, particularly on Chinese-centric questions and temporal understanding tasks like Event Localization (achieving only 45.2% maximum score). For AI practitioners, this benchmark provides a crucial tool for identifying weaknesses in LMMs' cross-cultural generalization and fine-grained temporal reasoning, highlighting areas needing improvement for developing more globally competent video understanding systems. |
| Can Large Language Models Help Multimodal Language Analysis? MMLA: A
  Comprehensive Benchmark (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16427) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.16427))| Peiwu Wang, Hua Xu, Yeshuang Zhu, Zhuohang Li, HanleiZhang | This paper introduces MMLA, a benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on multimodal language analysis. The objective is to assess the capability of these foundation models to comprehend high-level, cognitive semantics (intent, emotion, dialogue act, sentiment, speaking style, communication behavior) in human utterances. Methodology involves evaluating eight model families across nine datasets (61K+ utterances) using zero-shot inference, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and instruction tuning (IT). Results demonstrate that MLLMs significantly improve with SFT but still face challenges, achieving only about 60-70% average accuracy (best SFT model reaches 69.18%), indicating limitations in understanding complex human language nuances. For AI practitioners, this highlights that while fine-tuning substantially boosts performance and enables smaller models to rival larger ones, current MLLMs require further development to reliably decode complex multimodal semantics for applications like virtual assistants or social behavior analysis. |
| The Sparse Frontier: Sparse Attention Trade-offs in Transformer LLMs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17768) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.17768))| Kelly Marchisio, Sebastian Ruder, Renjie Huang, Robert Li, Piotr Nawrot | This paper presents a large-scale empirical comparison of training-free sparse attention methods in Transformer LLMs across various model sizes, sequence lengths, and sparsity levels. The main objective was to systematically evaluate the viability, efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, and scaling properties of sparse attention for long-context processing. Researchers compared six representative sparse attention patterns on nine diverse long-sequence tasks using Qwen 2.5 models (7B-72B) up to 128k sequence length, employing isoFLOPS analysis, statistical tests, and scaling law fitting. Key findings include: 1) isoFLOPS analysis shows large, highly sparse models are preferable to smaller, dense ones for very long sequences; 2) maximum tolerable sparsity without performance degradation varies significantly, often exceeding 10x on average but dropping below 5x for at least one task in most configurations; 3) no single method excels universally, with optimal choices being task- and phase-dependent. For AI practitioners, this implies sparse attention is a valuable tool for scaling to longer sequences but is not a universally applicable solution and demands careful, application-specific evaluation of performance trade-offs, as even moderate sparsity can cause significant degradation on sensitive tasks. |
| Subject-driven Video Generation via Disentangled Identity and Motion (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17816) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.17816))| Wonjoon Jin, Jingxu Zhang, cluo-ms, daiqi, carpedkm | This paper presents a zero-shot method for subject-driven video generation by factorizing identity injection and temporal modeling using image customization and unpaired video datasets. The primary objective is to achieve high-fidelity subject consistency and temporal coherence without relying on large-scale annotated subject-video (S2V) datasets. Key methodologies include fine-tuning a pre-trained Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) model via stochastically-switched optimization between identity learning (using an S2I dataset and LoRA) and temporal preservation (using unpaired videos and I2V fine-tuning), incorporating random frame selection and token dropping. The approach significantly outperforms baselines in zero-shot settings, achieving superior identity consistency (DINO-I: 59.29) and dynamic degree (60.19) on the VBench benchmark. For AI practitioners, this demonstrates a viable path to build scalable personalized video generation models using readily available image customization data, bypassing the significant cost and complexity of acquiring large annotated video datasets. |
| DianJin-R1: Evaluating and Enhancing Financial Reasoning in Large
  Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15716) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.15716))| Lifan Guo, Junhui Li, Huaixia Dou, Qian Chen, amazingj | The paper introduces DianJin-R1, an LLM framework enhancing financial reasoning via structured supervision and reinforcement learning using a curated dataset. The primary objective is to improve LLM performance on complex financial tasks requiring domain-specific knowledge, numerical calculation, and compliance adherence. Methodology involves fine-tuning Qwen2.5 models on the DianJin-R1-Data (derived from CFLUE, FinQA, CCC) to generate structured reasoning (<think>) and answers (<answer>), further refined using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with format and accuracy rewards. Key results show DianJin-R1 models significantly outperform non-reasoning counterparts; DianJin-R1-32B achieved 96.00% accuracy on the proprietary CCC compliance benchmark with a single API call, exceeding a multi-agent baseline requiring 8.15 calls. For AI practitioners, this demonstrates that combining structured reasoning supervision with targeted reinforcement learning provides a scalable and computationally efficient approach to building specialized LLMs for complex, domain-specific reasoning tasks like financial compliance. |
| DC-SAM: In-Context Segment Anything in Images and Videos via Dual
  Consistency (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12080) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.12080))| Lu Qi, Xiaoyang Bi, Xiangtai Li, Mengshi Qi, zaplm | DC-SAM adapts SAM/SAM2 for in-context image/video segmentation via prompt tuning and dual consistency. The objective is to enhance SAM's in-context segmentation ability by generating higher-quality visual prompts through better feature utilization and consistency, and to establish a benchmark for in-context video segmentation. The key methodology involves fusing SAM encoder features with backbone features, employing dual positive/negative prompt generation branches refined by cyclic consistent cross-attention, and using a mask-tube training strategy for video extension with SAM2. Primary results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving 55.5 mIoU (+1.4 improvement over VRP-SAM baseline) on COCO-20^2 and a J&F score of 71.52 on the proposed In-Context Video Object Segmentation (IC-VOS) benchmark. For AI practitioners, DC-SAM offers an efficient parameter-tuning approach to adapt foundation models like SAM/SAM2 for few-shot (specifically one-shot) segmentation tasks in both images and videos, improving prompt quality through explicit feature fusion and consistency enforcement. |
| Optimizing LLMs for Italian: Reducing Token Fertility and Enhancing
  Efficiency Through Vocabulary Adaptation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17025) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.17025))| Edoardo Barba, Andrei Stefan Bejgu, Pere-Lluis Huguet Cabot, Giovanni Puccetti, Luca Moroni | This paper introduces and evaluates vocabulary adaptation techniques, including the novel Semantic Alignment Vocabulary Adaptation (SAVA), for optimizing English Large Language Models (LLMs) for Italian. The primary objective is to compare different vocabulary adaptation methods against Language-Adaptive Pre-Training (LAPT) for adapting English LLMs (Mistral-7B-v0.1, Llama-3.1-8B) to Italian, focusing on token fertility reduction and downstream task performance. Methodology involves replacing the original tokenizer and embeddings using heuristics like Fast Vocabulary Transfer (FVT), Cross-Lingual Projection (CLP), the proposed SAVA (using neural mapping from a helper model, Minerva-3B), and random initialization, followed by continual training on Italian/English data. Results show that adapting Mistral-7B-v0.1 with the Minerva tokenizer reduced Italian token fertility by 25%, and adapting Llama-3.1-8B reduced its parameters by 1 billion (10% size reduction) due to vocabulary optimization; SAVA and FVT demonstrated competitive performance on downstream tasks, often converging faster during continual training than other methods. For AI practitioners, this indicates that vocabulary adaptation techniques like SAVA or FVT can significantly improve the efficiency (lower fertility, potentially smaller models) of deploying English-centric LLMs for other languages like Italian with relatively limited continual training. |

Evaluated on the introduced GEdit-Bench benchmark using GPT-4.1, Step1X-Edit achieves a G_O score of 6.701 (Full set, English instructions), significantly outperforming open-source baselines like OmniGen (5.061) and approaching proprietary models like Gemini2 Flash (6.315) and GPT-40 (7.534). For AI practitioners, this work provides a high-performing, open-source alternative for instruction-based image editing, along with a large-scale dataset and benchmark, facilitating the development and evaluation of general-purpose image manipulation capabilities. |
| RefVNLI: Towards Scalable Evaluation of Subject-driven Text-to-image
  Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17502) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.17502))| Michal Sokolik, Brian Gordon, Yonatan Bitton, Hagai Taitelbaum, lovodkin93 | REFVNLI introduces a cost-effective, fine-tuned VLM metric for evaluating both subject preservation and textual alignment in subject-driven text-to-image generation. The objective is to develop a single, automatic metric that reliably assesses both subject identity fidelity and prompt adherence in subject-driven T2I outputs, overcoming the limitations of costly or single-aspect existing evaluators. The methodology involves fine-tuning a PaliGemma vision-language model on a large-scale dataset (1.2M triplets) automatically curated from video reasoning benchmarks and image perturbations, performing sequential binary classifications for textual alignment then subject preservation. Primary results show REFVNLI matches or outperforms baselines across multiple benchmarks, achieving up to 8.5-point ROC AUC gains in subject consistency (ImagenHub, Multi-subject) and aligning with human preferences on rare entities over 87% of the time. For AI practitioners, REFVNLI provides a scalable, more reliable automated evaluation method for subject-driven T2I models, enabling faster iteration without dependence on expensive API calls or separate metrics that may not capture both essential generation qualities. |
| Paper2Code: Automating Code Generation from Scientific Papers in Machine
  Learning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17192) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.17192))| Sung Ju Hwang, Seongyun Lee, jinheon, iaminju | PaperCoder is a multi-agent LLM framework designed to automatically generate functional code repositories from machine learning research papers. The objective is to improve research reproducibility by automating the conversion of scientific papers into executable code, addressing the common issue of unavailable implementations. The methodology involves a three-stage pipeline using specialized LLM agents: Planning (roadmap, architecture design with diagrams, dependency/configuration generation), Analysis (interpreting file-specific implementation details), and Coding (generating modular, dependency-aware code sequentially). Evaluation on benchmarks like PaperBench showed PaperCoder achieved a 44.26% replication score, significantly outperforming strong baselines (e.g., 16.4% for Iterative Agent), and generated code required minimal manual modification (averaging 0.48% of lines changed) for execution in case studies. For AI practitioners, PaperCoder demonstrates a viable approach to automatically generate high-fidelity, nearly executable code directly from research papers, substantially reducing the effort required to reproduce results and build upon existing work when official code is missing. |
| Breaking the Modality Barrier: Universal Embedding Learning with
  Multimodal LLMs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17432) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.17432))| Yanzhao Zhang, Xingjun Wang, Ziyong Feng, Tiancheng Gu, Kaichengalex | This paper introduces UniME, a two-stage framework using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for universal multimodal embedding learning. The primary objective is to overcome limitations of CLIP and standard MLLMs to learn discriminative and transferable representations for diverse downstream vision-language tasks. UniME utilizes a two-stage methodology: (1) textual discriminative knowledge distillation from an LLM teacher model to enhance the MLLM's language component, and (2) hard negative enhanced instruction tuning with false negative filtering and hard negative sampling. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance, with UniME based on LLaVA-1.6 achieving a 66.6% overall score on the MMEB benchmark, a 3.3% improvement over the VLM2Vec baseline. For AI practitioners, this framework offers a method to adapt MLLMs for generating highly discriminative universal embeddings applicable across tasks like retrieval, VQA, classification, and grounding, enhancing multimodal understanding capabilities. |
| Perspective-Aware Reasoning in Vision-Language Models via Mental Imagery
  Simulation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17207) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.17207))| Leonidas Guibas, Mikaela Angelina Uy, Chanho Park, Jihyeon Je, Phillip Y. Lee | This paper introduces Abstract Perspective Change (APC), a framework enabling vision-language models (VLMs) to perform spatial reasoning from arbitrary viewpoints by simulating mental imagery. The main objective is to overcome the inherent egocentric bias in VLMs and equip them with robust allocentric reasoning capabilities necessary for understanding scenes from perspectives other than the camera's. APC utilizes vision foundation models (object detection, segmentation, orientation estimation) to build a coarse 3D scene abstraction, transforms this abstraction into the reference viewer's egocentric coordinate frame via coordinate transformation, and then prompts the VLM with this transformed representation (either numerically or visually). Experiments show APC significantly outperforms existing VLMs and reconstruction-based approaches, achieving 72.78% accuracy on the challenging 3DSRBench left/right spatial reasoning task using its visual prompt variant (APC-Vis), compared to significantly lower scores for baselines on real images. For AI practitioners, APC provides a concrete methodology to enhance VLM spatial intelligence for tasks requiring perspective shifts (like robotics or embodied AI) by effectively converting allocentric problems into egocentric ones that VLMs can readily solve. |
| QuaDMix: Quality-Diversity Balanced Data Selection for Efficient LLM
  Pretraining (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16511) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.16511))| Yifan Zhang, Zhimiao Yu, Binbin Liu, Weidong Zhou, Fengze Liu | This paper introduces QuaDMix, a unified framework to automatically optimize data selection for large language model (LLM) pretraining by jointly balancing data quality and diversity. The primary objective is to address the challenge of the inherent trade-off between quality and diversity, which prior methods often optimize separately. QuaDMix employs multiple quality scoring criteria and domain classification, feeding these features into a unified parameterized sampling function; optimal parameters are found efficiently using simulated experiments on small proxy models and a LightGBM regression model to predict performance. Experiments demonstrate QuaDMix achieves an average performance improvement of 7.2% across multiple benchmarks compared to methods optimizing quality or diversity independently, confirming the necessity of joint optimization. For AI practitioners, QuaDMix offers an automated approach to curate more effective pretraining datasets by systematically balancing quality and diversity, potentially improving LLM efficiency and downstream performance. |
| Token-Shuffle: Towards High-Resolution Image Generation with
  Autoregressive Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17789) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.17789))| Chih-Yao Ma, Hao Tang, Haoyu Ma, Peize Sun, Xu Ma | Token-Shuffle enables efficient high-resolution (up to 2048x2048) image generation with autoregressive models by reducing the computational load of visual tokens. The primary objective is to overcome the computational and resolution constraints imposed by the large number of image tokens required by standard autoregressive Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for image synthesis. Key methodology involves 'token-shuffle' to merge spatially local tokens via MLPs before Transformer blocks and 'token-unshuffle' to restore spatial arrangement after, exploiting visual vocabulary dimensional redundancy within a VQGAN-tokenized Llama framework. A 2.7B parameter Token-Shuffle model achieved a 0.77 overall score on the GenAI-benchmark hard prompts, outperforming prior AR models like LlamaGen by 0.18. This provides AI practitioners a plug-and-play method to build more efficient and higher-resolution autoregressive image generation MLLMs using existing architectures with minimal modification and without needing additional text encoders. |
| Distilling semantically aware orders for autoregressive image generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17069) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.17069))| David Vazquez, Masih Aminbeidokhti, Juan A. Rodriguez, Antoine Poupon, rishavpramanik | This paper introduces an autoregressive image generation method that learns a semantically aware order for generating image patches, improving quality over traditional raster-scan approaches. The main objective is to determine if learning an optimal, content-dependent patch generation order can enhance the quality of autoregressive image generation models without requiring additional annotations. The key methodology involves first training an any-given-order autoregressive model, using it to infer optimal generation orders for the training data via likelihood maximization at each step, and then fine-tuning the model using these self-supervised, distilled orders combined with relative positional encoding. On the Fashion Product dataset, the proposed fine-tuned ordered generation method achieved a Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) of 2.56, significantly improving upon the 4.58 FID of the baseline raster-scan model. For AI practitioners, this work demonstrates that the generation order in patch-based autoregressive models is a crucial factor impacting image quality, and learning this order dynamically based on content offers a viable path to enhance generation performance using self-supervision. |
| DyMU: Dynamic Merging and Virtual Unmerging for Efficient VLMs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17040) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.17040))| Heng Ji, Silvio Savarese, Caiming Xiong, Senthil Purushwalkam, Zhenhailong Wang | The paper introduces DyMU, a training-free framework to enhance the efficiency of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by dynamically adjusting visual token counts. The primary objective is to reduce the computational burden of VLMs, stemming from fixed-length visual token sequences, without sacrificing task performance or requiring model retraining. DyMU employs Dynamic Token Merging (DToMe) to merge redundant visual tokens based on image complexity and Virtual Token Unmerging (VTU) to efficiently reconstruct attention dynamics for the Large Language Model (LLM) using Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE). Experiments demonstrate DyMU can reduce average visual token counts by 32%-85%; specifically, DyMU-low on LLaVA-1.5 achieved 97.7% of the baseline performance using only ~15% of the original visual tokens. For AI practitioners, DyMU offers a plug-and-play method to significantly decrease the inference costs and computational requirements of existing VLMs without fine-tuning, enabling more efficient deployment. |
| IberBench: LLM Evaluation on Iberian Languages (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16921) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.16921))| Areg Mikael Sarvazyan, Álvaro Romo Herrero, Ian Borrego Obrador, José Ángel González, mchinea | IberBench introduces a comprehensive, extensible benchmark for evaluating LLM performance across Iberian languages, including Spanish varieties, focusing on both fundamental and industry-relevant tasks. The main objective is to assess LLM capabilities beyond English, addressing the limited coverage of Iberian languages, linguistic varieties, and task types in existing static benchmarks. The methodology involves compiling 101 datasets covering 22 task categories, standardizing them, and evaluating 23 LLMs (100M to 14B parameters) using a custom, incremental evaluation pipeline built upon `lm-evaluation-harness`, primarily in a zero-shot setting. Results indicate that LLMs generally perform worse on industry-relevant tasks than fundamental ones, exhibit lower average performance in Galician and Basque, and the top-performing model (Qwen-2.5-7b-Instruct) achieved a mean score of 46.8% across tasks and languages. For AI practitioners, IberBench provides a standardized tool and public leaderboard to compare LLM suitability for specific Iberian language applications, highlighting current model limitations in areas like industry relevance and performance on less-resourced languages like Basque and Galician, guiding model selection and development focus. |
| Boosting Generative Image Modeling via Joint Image-Feature Synthesis (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16064) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.16064))| Nikos Komodakis, Spyros Gidaris, Ioannis Kakogeorgiou, Efstathios Karypidis, Theodoros Kouzelis | ReDi enhances generative image modeling by jointly synthesizing low-level VAE image latents and high-level DINOv2 semantic features within a unified diffusion framework. The primary objective is to integrate representation learning directly into the generative process to improve synthesis quality and training convergence speed, bypassing explicit distillation steps. The core methodology involves modifying standard Diffusion Transformer architectures (DiT/SiT) to operate on a combined input of noise-corrupted VAE latents and PCA-reduced DINOv2 features, learning the joint distribution via a shared denoising objective, and introducing Representation Guidance for inference refinement. Key results demonstrate substantial improvements, such as accelerating SiT-XL/2 convergence by >6x compared to prior representation alignment methods (REPA) and achieving a state-of-the-art FID of 1.64 on ImageNet 256x256 (CFG). For AI practitioners, ReDi offers a method to train high-fidelity generative models significantly faster and introduces Representation Guidance as a novel technique to steer image generation using learned semantic features. |
| ViSMaP: Unsupervised Hour-long Video Summarisation by Meta-Prompting (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15921) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.15921))| Mariano Beguerisse-Diaz, Shaogang Gong, Dimitrios Korkinof, Jian Hu | ViSMaP presents an unsupervised method for summarizing hour-long videos by adapting models trained on short videos using meta-prompting. The objective is to generate coherent summaries for long, unannotated videos, bridging the semantic gap between short segment descriptions and holistic long video narratives without costly long-form annotations. Key methodology involves pre-training a model on short videos, using iterative meta-prompting with multiple LLMs (generator, evaluator, optimizer) to create pseudo-summaries for long videos, and fine-tuning the model using these pseudo-summaries with a noisy label loss. Primary results demonstrate performance comparable to supervised methods, achieving a 26.0 CIDEr score on the Ego4D-HCap dataset versus 29.3 for the fully supervised VideoReCap, despite requiring no human annotations for the long videos. This provides AI practitioners a framework to summarize large volumes of unlabelled long videos by leveraging existing short-video datasets and LLMs, drastically reducing the need for expensive manual annotation. |
| 3DV-TON: Textured 3D-Guided Consistent Video Try-on via Diffusion Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17414) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.17414))| Fan Wang, Jingkai Zhou, Chaohui Yu, Min Wei | 3DV-TON introduces a diffusion-based video try-on framework employing textured 3D guidance to enhance temporal consistency and fidelity. The primary objective is to generate high-quality, temporally coherent try-on videos by mitigating the appearance bias inherent in pixel-reconstruction objectives which often leads to motion artifacts. Its methodology utilizes adaptively generated, animatable textured 3D meshes as explicit frame-level guidance for a diffusion model, complemented by a rectangular masking strategy to prevent information leakage. Quantitatively, on the ViViD dataset, 3DV-TON* achieved a paired VFID_I3D score of 10.9680, surpassing the baseline ViViD method's score of 17.2924 (lower indicates better generation quality and temporal consistency). For AI practitioners, the key implication is that leveraging explicit, textured 3D spatio-temporal guidance within diffusion models can significantly improve motion coherence and detail preservation in complex video generation tasks like virtual try-on. |
| TimeChat-Online: 80% Visual Tokens are Naturally Redundant in Streaming
  Videos (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17343) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.17343))| Shuhuai Ren, Lei Li, Yuancheng Wei, Yicheng Li, Linli Yao | TimeChat-Online introduces the Differential Token Drop (DTD) module to achieve efficient streaming video understanding by exploiting visual redundancy. The primary objective is to enable real-time, interactive VideoLLMs capable of handling long, redundant streaming videos and performing proactive responses. The core methodology involves the DTD module, which adaptively drops visually similar tokens between consecutive frames based on pixel or feature-level similarity, preserving only significant temporal changes and associated spatial-temporal positions. Experiments show DTD removes 82.8% of video tokens on StreamingBench while retaining 98% of the original accuracy and achieving a 1.76x latency speedup. For AI practitioners, this demonstrates that leveraging natural video redundancy through query-agnostic token dropping can drastically reduce computational costs and improve efficiency for deploying VideoLLMs in real-time streaming applications, especially for long-duration videos. |
| Interpretable non-linear dimensionality reduction using gaussian
  weighted linear transformation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17601) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.17601))| erikbergh | This paper introduces an interpretable non-linear dimensionality reduction method using Gaussian-weighted linear transformations. The objective is to combine the representational power of non-linear techniques with the interpretability of linear methods. The methodology involves constructing a non-linear mapping as a weighted sum of multiple linear transformations, where weights are derived from normalized Gaussian functions centered throughout the data space, optimized to preserve pairwise distances. Applied to a 3D S-curve dataset reduced to 2D, the algorithm achieved a reconstruction error of 0.45 and allowed for quantifying dimension influence (e.g., y-dimension contributed 0.25 overall influence) and visualizing spatial variations in transformation properties like influence skewness and space contraction. For AI practitioners, this offers a dimensionality reduction tool that provides non-linear expressiveness while enabling analysis of how original dimensions contribute to the reduced space and how geometric properties change locally. |
| Process Reward Models That Think (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16828) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.16828))| Hao Peng, Jaekyeom Kim, Lajanugen Logeswaran, Rishabh Agarwal, Muhammad Khalifa | This paper introduces THINKPRM, a data-efficient generative process reward model (PRM) that verifies reasoning steps using long Chain-of-Thought (CoT). The objective is to create PRMs that are both high-performing and require significantly less supervision data compared to traditional discriminative PRMs. The methodology involves lightweight fine-tuning of large reasoning models on a small dataset of filtered synthetic verification CoTs (using as few as 8K process labels). Key results show THINKPRM outperforms discriminative PRMs trained on ~100x more data and LLM-as-a-judge baselines, achieving an 8% improvement over a discriminative PRM on a GPQA-Diamond subset despite using far less training data. For AI practitioners, this demonstrates the potential to build powerful and scalable reasoning verifiers with minimal supervision by leveraging generative models and CoT verification, reducing reliance on large labeled process datasets. |

| VisuLogic: A Benchmark for Evaluating Visual Reasoning in Multi-modal
  Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15279) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.15279))| Einsiedler, luotto, Weiyun1025, GenuineWWD, wilye | This paper introduces VisuLogic, a benchmark designed to evaluate genuine vision-centric reasoning in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). The research aims to address the limitation that current MLLM evaluations often rely on textual descriptions, allowing language-based shortcuts instead of measuring true visual reasoning. The methodology involves a new benchmark of 1,000 human-verified visual problems across six categories (quantitative, spatial, positional, attribute, stylistic, other), designed to be difficult to solve via text description alone, on which leading MLLMs and humans were evaluated. Primary results show a significant gap: most evaluated MLLMs achieved below 30% accuracy (e.g., Doubao-1.5-Vision-Pro at 28.1%), far below the human baseline of 51.4% and only slightly above the 25% random baseline. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that current MLLMs possess weak visual reasoning capabilities, necessitating better evaluation benchmarks and development focus on genuine vision-centric understanding, potentially leveraging techniques like reinforcement learning which showed promise (improving a baseline to 31.1%). |

The primary objective is to significantly improve identity (ID) similarity and attribute preservation in face swapping while achieving rapid inference speed. Key methodology involves constructing Triplet ID Group data (source A1, pseudo target B, ground truth A2) for explicit pixel-level supervision, leveraging the accelerated Stable Diffusion Turbo (SD Turbo) model for single-step inference, and utilizing an improved architecture comprising SwapNet, FaceNet, and an ID Adapter. The primary result shows state-of-the-art performance, achieving 0.71 ID similarity and generating 512x512 resolution swaps in just 0.6 seconds. For AI practitioners, this work provides a significantly faster and more accurate face swapping technique by enabling effective end-to-end training with explicit image-space loss functions, overcoming limitations of implicit supervision in prior diffusion-based methods. |
| Trillion 7B Technical Report (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15431) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.15431))| Suyeong An, hist0613, kyudolski, scottsuk0306, sungjunhan-trl | Trillion-7B is introduced as a highly token-efficient, Korean-centric multilingual Large Language Model. The research aims to address the data imbalance in multilingual LLM training, enabling effective knowledge transfer from English to target languages like Korean despite data scarcity. Key methodologies include the novel Cross-lingual Document Attention (XLDA) mechanism, optimized data mixtures, language-specific filtering, a tailored tokenizer, and a two-stage pre-training approach. Trillion-7B achieves competitive performance across 27 benchmarks using only 10% multilingual data within its 2T token training budget, requiring 59.4K H100 GPU hours ($148K) for full training. For AI practitioners, this demonstrates that architectural innovations like XLDA and strategic training can enable efficient development of high-performing multilingual models for less-resourced languages, reducing reliance on massive language-specific data scaling. |
| Pre-DPO: Improving Data Utilization in Direct Preference Optimization
  Using a Guiding Reference Model (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15843) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.15843))| Yue Zhang, Qiji Zhou, Shulin Huang, Junshu Pan, Swtheking | Pre-DPO is a training paradigm enhancing DPO and SimPO preference optimization by leveraging a guiding reference model derived from an initial optimization pass for improved data utilization. The research objective was to overcome inefficient data weighting and performance ceilings inherent in standard DPO/SimPO reference model configurations. Methodologically, Pre-DPO involves first optimizing an initial policy, setting this optimized policy as a guiding reference model, and subsequently re-optimizing the initial policy using DPO under the guidance of this new reference. Experimental results show Pre-DPO consistently outperforms standard DPO and SimPO, achieving average improvements of 2.5 points on AlpacaEval 2 LC and boosting Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct Arena-Hard v0.1 WR from 62.9 (DPO) to 68.8. For AI practitioners, this provides a technique to enhance preference optimization outcomes using existing models and data by enabling more effective adaptive data reweighting, potentially raising performance ceilings. |
| I-Con: A Unifying Framework for Representation Learning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16929) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.16929))| John Hershey, Shaden Alshammari, mhamilton723, mrpuppt, axelf | I-Con introduces a unified information-theoretic framework generalizing numerous representation learning methods by minimizing an integrated KL divergence between supervisory and learned conditional neighborhood distributions. The primary objective is to demonstrate that diverse techniques like clustering, contrastive learning, dimensionality reduction, and supervised learning are special cases of this single underlying loss function. The methodology involves defining specific conditional probability distributions (p and q) for existing algorithms (e.g., SNE, SimCLR, K-Means, Cross-Entropy) to show their equivalence to minimizing the I-Con objective, proving 15 theorems connecting over 23 methods. Key results include the theoretical unification itself and the creation of a novel debiased clustering method achieving a +8% improvement in Hungarian accuracy on unsupervised ImageNet-1K classification over the previous state-of-the-art. For AI practitioners, I-Con provides a principled foundation for understanding the relationships between disparate loss functions, enabling the transfer of techniques across domains and the development of improved or novel representation learning algorithms, particularly for unsupervised tasks. |
| Decoupled Global-Local Alignment for Improving Compositional
  Understanding (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16801) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.16801))| Ziyong Feng, Jun Wang, haoranxu, Kaichengalex, xiaoxing2001 | This paper introduces DeGLA, a framework enhancing vision-language models' compositional understanding while maintaining general capabilities by decoupling global self-distillation alignment from local contrastive alignment using LLM-generated hard negatives. The main objective is to overcome the limitation where improving compositional reasoning in models like CLIP often degrades their general performance due to catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. DeGLA utilizes self-distillation with an EMA teacher for global alignment and introduces Image-Grounded Contrast (IGC) and Text-Grounded Contrast (TGC) losses with ~2M LLM-generated negative captions for local alignment. Compared to the CE-CLIP baseline, DeGLA shows an average 3.5% improvement across VALSE, SugarCrepe, and ARO compositional benchmarks and a 13.0% average improvement across 11 zero-shot classification datasets. For AI practitioners, DeGLA offers a method to fine-tune vision-language models for improved nuanced understanding (e.g., attribute binding, relations) in multimodal tasks without significantly sacrificing their robust zero-shot transfer abilities. |
| DreamO: A Unified Framework for Image Customization (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16915) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.16915))| LemonSky1995, Crayon-Shinchan, shiwenzh, Zinan123212, yanze | DreamO provides a unified framework based on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) for diverse image customization tasks using lightweight adaptation. The objective is to overcome the limitations of task-specific models by enabling flexible integration and interaction of multiple control conditions (identity, subject, style, try-on) within a single model. The methodology involves fine-tuning a pre-trained DiT (Flux-1.0-dev) using LoRA, introducing a feature routing constraint based on cross-attention supervision for fidelity and disentanglement, a placeholder strategy for positional control, and a three-stage progressive training strategy. Qualitative results demonstrate high-fidelity generation across multiple conditions with only 707M additional trainable LoRA parameters, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the routing constraint and progressive training. For AI practitioners, DreamO offers a method to implement versatile, multi-conditional image customization capabilities efficiently using a single, lightweight adapted model, reducing the need for multiple specialized systems. |
| Tina: Tiny Reasoning Models via LoRA (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15777) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.15777))| Ollie Liu, Enes Burak Bilgin, Ömer Faruk Akgül, Julian Asilis, upup-ashton-wang | This paper introduces Tina, a family of cost-effective 1.5B parameter reasoning models developed by applying LoRA during RL. The research objective is to determine how cost-effectively strong reasoning abilities can be achieved in small language models using minimal computational resources. Key methodology involves applying parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation (LoRA) updates during reinforcement learning (specifically, a GRPO-style algorithm) to a tiny 1.5B parameter base model, using open-source frameworks and minimal hardware. Primary results demonstrate that Tina models achieve reasoning performance competitive with, and sometimes superior to, full-parameter trained SOTA RL models on the same base; the best Tina model attained a 50.60% average score across six reasoning benchmarks, significantly outperforming its 41.60% full-parameter baseline average, at an estimated $9 post-training and evaluation cost. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that LoRA combined with RL provides a highly resource-efficient pathway to substantially enhance reasoning capabilities in smaller LMs, achieving significant performance gains with minimal computational expenditure, potentially by rapidly adapting the model's output format. |
| A Comprehensive Survey in LLM(-Agent) Full Stack Safety: Data, Training
  and Deployment (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15585) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.15585))| Guibin Zhang, Kun Wang, Ningyu, Atarogic, Fred456 | This survey introduces "full-stack" LLM safety, comprehensively analyzing security and safety issues across the entire LLM lifecycle, from data to deployment. The primary objective is to systematically categorize safety considerations throughout all stages of LLM development (data preparation, pre-training, post-training including alignment, editing, unlearning, and agent integration) and deployment, identifying gaps in existing research that focuses on isolated phases. The methodology involves an extensive literature review encompassing over 800 papers, synthesized into a novel "full-stack" taxonomic framework that maps safety risks and defenses across the defined LLM lifecycle stages. Key results include the identification of persistent risks such as data poisoning (e.g., 0.1% poisoned data causing lasting impact even after fine-tuning), privacy leakage from training data memorization, vulnerabilities introduced during fine-tuning/alignment (like RLHF reward model poisoning), and novel attack surfaces in LLM-based agents involving tool use and memory manipulation. The principal implication for AI practitioners is the critical need to integrate safety considerations throughout the entire development and deployment pipeline, recognizing that security is not merely a deployment-stage concern but is deeply intertwined with data sourcing, training methodologies, alignment processes, and the integration of external modules in agentic systems. |
| RePOPE: Impact of Annotation Errors on the POPE Benchmark (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15707) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.15707))| Matthias Hein, YanNeu | This paper assesses the impact of annotation errors in the MSCOCO dataset on the POPE object hallucination benchmark and introduces a corrected version called RePOPE. The objective is to quantify how these underlying label errors influence the evaluation and ranking of Vision Large Language Models (VLMs) for object hallucination. The methodology involved re-annotating all 500 images used in POPE by consensus, identifying errors and ambiguous cases, creating the corrected RePOPE labels by fixing errors and removing ambiguities, and re-evaluating various VLMs. Primary results show significant label errors, particularly 9.3% errors and 13.8% ambiguous cases in the positive ("Yes") set of POPE, leading to substantial shifts in model F1 score rankings on RePOPE compared to the original benchmark. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that evaluations based on the original POPE benchmark are notably affected by annotation quality, and using RePOPE offers a more reliable assessment, potentially changing conclusions about relative model performance regarding hallucinations. |
| Rethinking the Generation of High-Quality CoT Data from the Perspective
  of LLM-Adaptive Question Difficulty Grading (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11919) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.11919))| Keyu Wu, Kunlinliu2, MeiManlin, zcs1234, USTCYu | This paper introduces LLM-adaptive difficulty grading to generate high-quality CoT data, enabling smaller LLMs to achieve superior reasoning performance. The objective is to determine if LLM-adaptive question difficulty grading can efficiently produce high-quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data tailored to enhance smaller LLM reasoning capabilities. The methodology involves grading questions using a base LLM's performance (correctness check + PRM-Grader), constructing an adaptive question database, sampling based on difficulty distribution, and generating verified CoT using DeepSeek-R1 as a teacher model. Results show that a 32B model fine-tuned on just 2k adaptively generated math CoT examples (ZMath-32B) significantly outperformed the DeepSeek-Distill-32B baseline on math benchmarks (e.g., 73.33% vs 66.67% accuracy on AIME24). For AI practitioners, this indicates that smaller, intelligently curated CoT datasets based on adaptive difficulty grading can be highly resource-efficient for substantially improving the reasoning abilities of smaller LLMs through supervised fine-tuning. |
| CRUST-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for C-to-safe-Rust Transpilation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15254) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.15254))| Ziteng Wang, Jia Pan, Robert Zhang, gregdurrett, anirudhkhatry | This paper introduces CRUST-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating C-to-safe-Rust transpilation using 100 C repositories with manually defined Rust interfaces and test cases. The research objective is to assess the ability of current transpilation systems, particularly LLMs, to generate functionally correct, memory-safe, and idiomatic Rust code from entire C repositories. The methodology involved creating the CRUST-Bench dataset by sourcing C repositories, manually authoring corresponding safe Rust interfaces and test suites, and using this framework to evaluate various LLMs and agentic systems. Primary results show that current state-of-the-art LLMs find this task challenging; the best performing model, OpenAI o1, solved only 15% of tasks single-shot, improving to 37% with iterative test-based repair, highlighting frequent errors in type handling, borrowing rules, and incomplete implementations. For AI practitioners, this implies that fully automated, reliable C-to-safe-Rust migration for complex projects using current LLMs remains an open challenge, necessitating significant improvements in handling Rust's strict safety and ownership semantics or requiring human oversight. |
| Unchecked and Overlooked: Addressing the Checkbox Blind Spot in Large
  Language Models with CheckboxQA (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10419) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.10419))| Borchmann, sf-mchilinski, mturski | This paper introduces CheckboxQA, a benchmark dataset to evaluate and improve Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) performance on interpreting checkboxes in documents. The primary objective is to assess and address the significant challenge LVLMs face with accurately identifying checkbox states and their associated context, a crucial but often overlooked aspect of document understanding. The authors curated the CheckboxQA dataset comprising 88 documents and 579 question-answer pairs focused on checkbox interpretation and evaluated baseline LVLMs using the Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity (ANLS*) metric. Results show that even top-performing models like Qwen 2.5 VL 72B (83.2 ANLS*) lag significantly behind human performance (97.5 ANLS*), indicating substantial room for improvement. For AI practitioners, this research underscores that robust document processing requires specific attention to fine-grained visual elements like checkboxes, as general LVLM proficiency does not automatically transfer, necessitating targeted datasets and potentially model adaptations for reliable real-world applications. |
| Progressive Language-guided Visual Learning for Multi-Task Visual
  Grounding (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16145) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.16145))| Dingjiang Huang, Kunhua Ji, Wenlong Zhang, Hong Wang, jcwang0602 | This paper introduces PLVL, a Progressive Language-guided Visual Learning framework for Multi-Task Visual Grounding (MTVG), integrating Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) and Segmentation (RES). The main objective is to address insufficient language injection into visual backbones and ineffective exploitation of the REC-RES task relationship in existing methods. PLVL utilizes a modified ViTDet backbone with local and global blocks, progressively injecting language tokens via cross-attention in global blocks, and employs a novel convolution-based collaborative multi-task head exploiting shared object localization priors. Results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving 89.80% accuracy on the RefCOCOg test(U) REC task under pre-training settings, outperforming previous methods. For AI practitioners, PLVL offers a more effective architecture for joint REC/RES prediction by deeply integrating language guidance throughout the visual feature extraction process and explicitly modeling task synergy, leading to improved grounding accuracy. |

| Kuwain 1.5B: An Arabic SLM via Language Injection (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15120) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.15120))| Omar Hadid, Sara Chrouf, ZeinaD, Moatasem444, Hennara | This paper introduces Kuwain 1.5B, an Arabic-English Small Language Model created via language injection into an existing English model. The primary objective was to efficiently integrate Arabic into an English-centric LLM (TinyLlama 1.1B) without compromising its original knowledge or incurring high retraining costs. The methodology involved expanding the tokenizer with 26K Arabic tokens and inserting 8 new, trainable layers into the model architecture while freezing the original layers, using only 20% of the original English data alongside a large Arabic corpus. Results demonstrated an average 8% performance improvement on Arabic benchmarks compared to the base model, while maintaining comparable performance on English benchmarks (53.28 average score vs. 52.99 for the base model). For AI practitioners, this work presents a resource-efficient language injection technique to expand model capabilities to new languages, especially low-resource ones, without extensive retraining or significant degradation of existing knowledge. |
| TTRL: Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16084) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.16084))| Xuekai Zhu, Li Sheng, Shang Qu, Yuxin Zuo, iseesaw | This paper introduces Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), a method for improving Large Language Models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks using unlabeled test data. The objective is to enable LLM self-evolution using Reinforcement Learning (RL) during inference without access to ground-truth labels, addressing the challenge of reward estimation in this setting. TTRL employs repeated sampling to generate multiple outputs, uses majority voting to estimate a consensus label, and computes rule-based rewards based on this estimate to drive RL training. Experiments show TTRL boosted Qwen-2.5-Math-7B pass@1 performance on AIME 2024 by approximately 159% using only unlabeled test data, and consistently surpassed the performance upper limit implied by the initial model's majority voting accuracy. For AI practitioners, TTRL demonstrates a method for adapting and improving LLMs on new tasks using unlabeled data alone, suggesting a potential pathway for continuous learning and reduced reliance on extensive labeled datasets for RL fine-tuning. |
| The Bitter Lesson Learned from 2,000+ Multilingual Benchmarks (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15521) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.15521))| Huifeng Yin, Sinuo Liu, Weixuan Wang, Minghao Wu, ChenyangLyu | This paper analyzes over 2,000 multilingual (non-English) benchmarks (2021-2024) to evaluate past, present, and future multilingual benchmarking practices. The primary objective is to assess historical trends, the current alignment of benchmarks with human judgments, and future needs for multilingual evaluation. The methodology involved collecting and annotating 2,024 arXiv papers, analyzing language/task/domain distributions, and correlating LLM performance on benchmarks with human Elo rankings across five languages. Key findings reveal English overrepresentation despite exclusion, poor correlation for translated benchmarks (e.g., MMLU Chinese correlation 0.473 vs. localized CMMLU 0.682), and better alignment for STEM tasks (0.70-0.85 correlation) than traditional NLP tasks like QA (0.11-0.30). The principal implication for AI practitioners is that evaluating multilingual models requires moving beyond translated English benchmarks towards developing localized, culturally authentic, and human-aligned benchmarks for accurate capability assessment. |
| Describe Anything: Detailed Localized Image and Video Captioning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16072) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.16072))| Yifan Ding, richardaecn, yala, Boyiliee, longlian | This paper introduces the Describe Anything Model (DAM) for generating detailed captions for specific regions in images and videos. The primary objective is to overcome limitations in existing VLMs regarding precise localization and the generation of detailed, context-aware regional descriptions. DAM employs a focal prompt for high-resolution encoding of target regions and a localized vision backbone that integrates global context with local details using gated cross-attention, trained via a novel semi-supervised data pipeline (DLC-SDP). The model achieves state-of-the-art results on 7 benchmarks, including a 67.3% average accuracy on the newly proposed DLC-Bench. For AI practitioners, DAM offers a robust method for fine-grained visual understanding, enabling applications requiring detailed descriptions of user-specified image or video regions without relying on reference captions for evaluation. |
| Learning Adaptive Parallel Reasoning with Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15466) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.15466))| Charlie Snell, Long Lian, Jiayi Pan, yala, xiuyul | This paper introduces Adaptive Parallel Reasoning (APR), a framework enabling language models to learn adaptive parallelization of reasoning tasks using parent-child threading. The research objective is to overcome limitations of serialized chain-of-thought (latency, context limits) and simple parallel methods (redundancy, poor coordination) by training models to dynamically orchestrate both serial and parallel computations. APR employs a multi-threading mechanism with `spawn()` and `join()` operations, integrated into the language model's decoding process and optimized end-to-end using reinforcement learning. On the Countdown reasoning task, APR achieved significantly higher accuracy within a fixed context window (83.4% vs. 60.0% for serialized search at 4k context) and better accuracy at equivalent latency (75.2% vs. 57.3% at ~5000ms). The principal implication for AI practitioners is that LMs can be trained to autonomously manage and parallelize their inference-time computation, potentially leading to more efficient and scalable reasoning systems under resource constraints. |
| IV-Bench: A Benchmark for Image-Grounded Video Perception and Reasoning
  in Multimodal LLMs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15415) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.15415))| Yifan Yao, Jarvis Guo, Yuanxing Zhang, JinChengRen, mdh98 | IV-Bench is introduced as the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) specifically on image-grounded video perception and reasoning tasks. The research objective is to assess how effectively MLLMs utilize external static images as indispensable context for video comprehension, a capability largely overlooked by existing benchmarks. The methodology involved creating a dataset of 967 videos paired with 2,585 meticulously annotated image-text queries across 13 tasks (7 perception, 6 reasoning) using externally sourced, necessary images, followed by evaluating 27 state-of-the-art open and closed-source MLLMs. The primary result shows current MLLMs significantly underperform, with the best model achieving only 28.9% overall accuracy, and performance deteriorating further on reasoning tasks (best at 24.9%). For AI practitioners, this implies a critical need to develop advanced MLLMs with improved mechanisms for integrating external image context into video understanding, as current models struggle significantly with these tasks and simple data format alignment proves insufficient. |
| BookWorld: From Novels to Interactive Agent Societies for Creative Story
  Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14538) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.14538))| Yanghua Xiao, Jiaqing Liang, Tian Qiu, Xintao Wang, Yiting Ran | BookWorld introduces a system for constructing and simulating multi-agent societies based on fictional novels for creative story generation. The primary objective is to explore simulating established fictional worlds and characters using book data, enabling character-driven storytelling and interactive experiences. The methodology involves extracting character profiles, worldview data, and map information from source texts to initialize role agents and a world agent, which orchestrate interactions, memory updates, and movements within scene-based simulations managed by LLMs. BookWorld demonstrated superior performance in generating high-quality, faithful narratives, surpassing previous methods with a win rate of 75.36% in comparative evaluations. For AI practitioners, this research provides a framework for leveraging existing literary works to create immersive, context-rich simulations and interactive story generation applications, reducing the need for manual world-building. |
| Efficient Pretraining Length Scaling (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14992) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.14992))| Jianqiao Lu, Sijun Zhang, Shen Yan, Taoer, bongbohong | This paper introduces the Parallel Hidden Decoding (PHD) Transformer framework to enable efficient length scaling during language model pre-training. The objective is to achieve the performance benefits of increased sequence length during pre-training without proportionally increasing KV cache size or inference latency. The core methodology involves repeating input tokens multiple times but employing a novel KV cache strategy where only the cache from original tokens is retained globally, while the cache from repeated ("hidden decoding") tokens is discarded or kept only within a local/chunk-wise window (PHD-SWA/PHD-CSWA). Results demonstrate consistent performance improvements; for instance, the PHD-CSWA-3-16-32 variant achieved a 2.0% average accuracy increase across evaluated benchmarks compared to a 1.2B parameter baseline, with minimal impact on inference efficiency. For AI practitioners, this work presents a method (PHD-CSWA) to enhance model reasoning capabilities through pre-training length scaling without the typical memory and latency penalties, offering a practical approach to scale computational depth efficiently. |

  Learning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13820) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.13820))| Shiji Song, Pan Liu, Chenxin Tao, Yulin Wang, yueyang2000 | CheXWorld introduces a self-supervised world modeling framework for learning robust radiograph representations by capturing anatomical knowledge and domain variations. The primary objective is to develop a unified framework that models local anatomical structures, global anatomical layouts, and domain appearance variations essential for radiograph interpretation. Key methodology involves integrating these three aspects through tailored prediction tasks within a joint-embedding predictive architecture, predicting target representations based on context and latent variables (relative position, augmentation parameters). CheXWorld significantly outperforms existing self-supervised learning methods on eight medical image classification and segmentation benchmarks, achieving 95.24±0.13 AUROC on VinDr-CXR classification. For AI practitioners, the principal implication is that this world modeling approach yields highly effective and transferable representations for diverse radiograph analysis tasks, potentially reducing the need for extensive labeled data. |
| Personalized Text-to-Image Generation with Auto-Regressive Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13162) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.13162))| Xihui Liu, Yao Teng, Xian Liu, Kaiyue Sun | This research investigates personalized text-to-image generation using auto-regressive (AR) models, adapting them for a task typically dominated by diffusion models. The primary objective is to evaluate the potential of optimizing AR models for personalized image synthesis by leveraging their unified architecture for text and image modeling. The methodology involves a two-stage training strategy: first optimizing text embeddings associated with a unique identifier for the subject, and second, fine-tuning the model's transformer layers using 3-5 reference images. Experiments on the Lumina-mGPT 7B model demonstrated comparable subject fidelity (DINO: 0.671) and prompt following (CLIP-T: 0.314) to the diffusion-based DreamBooth method (DINO: 0.668, CLIP-T: 0.305) on the Dreambench dataset. For AI practitioners, this work highlights that appropriately optimized AR models present a viable alternative architecture for personalized image generation, achieving competitive fidelity and prompt adherence compared to established diffusion techniques, although generation speed is noted as slower. |
| LiveCC: Learning Video LLM with Streaming Speech Transcription at Scale (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16030) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.16030))| Zejun Ma, Wei Li, Yiqi Lin, Ziyun Zeng, Joya Chen | LiveCC introduces a Video LLM trained at scale using densely interleaved, timestamped automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts for real-time video commentary. The primary objective is to enable scalable Video LLM training leveraging cheap ASR data for fine-grained, temporally-aligned vision-language modeling and low-latency inference. Key methodology involves a novel streaming training approach on curated datasets (Live-CC-5M, Live-WhisperX-526K) derived from YouTube closed captions. The final LiveCC-7B-Instruct model surpasses 72B models in commentary quality on the LiveSports-3K benchmark (achieving a 41.5% win rate against LLaVA-Video-72B) and achieves state-of-the-art results on VideoMME/OVOBench QA benchmarks at the 7B scale, with commentary latency under 0.5 seconds per frame. For AI practitioners, this work demonstrates a cost-effective and scalable method using readily available ASR data to develop high-performance, real-time Video LLMs, reducing dependency on expensive annotations or APIs. |
| Vidi: Large Multimodal Models for Video Understanding and Editing (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15681) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.15681))| Fan Chen, Chia-Wen Kuo, Celong Liu, Vidi Team, daviddousa | Vidi is a family of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) designed for long-duration video understanding and editing, initially focused on temporal retrieval using vision, audio, and text. The primary objective is to develop a multimodal AI model capable of accurately performing temporal retrieval (identifying specific time ranges based on text/audio queries) within hour-long videos by processing visual, auditory, and textual information simultaneously. Vidi employs modality-specific encoders (SigLIP, Whisper), adapter layers, and a Mistral-7B LLM core utilizing Decomposed Attention for efficient processing of densely sampled (1fps visual, 16kHz audio), long multimodal sequences, trained via multi-stage alignment on synthetic and real annotated video data. On the introduced VUE-TR benchmark designed for realistic, long-form video retrieval, Vidi significantly outperforms proprietary models, achieving an overall Intersection-over-Union Area Under Curve (IoU AUC) of 35.4% compared to 21.2% (Gemini-2.0-Flash), 15.2% (Gemini-2.5-Pro), and 13.6% (GPT-4o). For AI practitioners, Vidi demonstrates a viable architecture using Decomposed Attention for building LMMs that can efficiently process and temporally ground queries in hour-long multimodal videos, offering a strong foundation for developing advanced, scalable video editing and retrieval applications. |
| From Reflection to Perfection: Scaling Inference-Time Optimization for
  Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via Reflection Tuning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16080) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.16080))| Renrui Zhang, Yue Liao, Sayak Paul, Liangbing Zhao, Le Zhuo | This paper introduces ReflectionFlow, an inference-time optimization framework that enables text-to-image diffusion models to iteratively refine their outputs via self-reflection. The objective is to improve image generation quality for complex prompts by scaling inference-time computation rather than solely relying on larger pre-trained models. Key methodology involves proposing three scaling axes (noise, prompt, reflection), constructing the large-scale GenRef dataset (1 million reflection triplets plus 227K CoT annotations), and performing efficient reflection tuning on the FLUX.1-dev diffusion transformer by jointly modeling multimodal inputs (prompt, reflection, flawed image, target image) in a unified sequence. The primary result shows ReflectionFlow significantly improves performance, achieving a GenEval score of 0.91 with 32 samples, outperforming the FLUX.1-dev baseline (0.67) and naive noise scaling (0.85), and requiring 10x fewer samples than noise scaling for similar performance levels. For AI practitioners, this offers a scalable, compute-efficient inference-time technique to enhance the fidelity and detail of generated images for challenging prompts without modifying the underlying generative model architecture or extensive retraining. |
| LLMs are Greedy Agents: Effects of RL Fine-tuning on Decision-Making
  Abilities (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16078) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.16078))| Razvan Pascanu, Markus Wulfmeier, Jordi Grau-Moya, Jörg Bornschein, Thomas Schmied | This paper investigates why LLMs act sub-optimally as decision-making agents and evaluates Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) to improve their performance. The research aims to identify the causes of sub-optimal LLM decision-making, specifically greediness, frequency bias, and the knowing-doing gap, and to determine if RLFT on self-generated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales can mitigate these issues. Methodology involved analyzing Gemma2 models (2B, 9B, 27B) on multi-armed/contextual bandits and Tic-tac-toe, quantifying failure modes, applying RLFT with a PPO-like objective on CoT outputs, and evaluating various exploration strategies. Primary results indicate LLMs exhibit a knowing-doing gap (e.g., 87% correct rationales but acting greedily 58% of that time) and poor exploration (e.g., 27B model covering only 45% of actions in 20-arm MABs); RLFT improved exploration (e.g., +12% action coverage for 2B model after 30k steps) and reduced regret, partially mitigating greediness and frequency bias. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that base LLMs require explicit mechanisms beyond CoT prompting for effective exploration; RLFT on CoT rationales, especially enhanced with exploration bonuses or reward shaping, significantly improves decision-making but does not eliminate the need for careful consideration of exploration strategies in agentic systems. |
| WALL-E 2.0: World Alignment by NeuroSymbolic Learning improves World
  Model-based LLM Agents (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15785) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.15785))| Deheng Ye, Guodong Long, Yijun Yang, Siyu Zhou, zhoutianyi | WALL-E 2.0 enhances LLM agent performance by aligning LLM-based world models with environment dynamics through neurosymbolic learning of executable code rules. The primary objective is to bridge the gap between LLM prior knowledge and specific environment dynamics, creating more accurate world models for LLM agents without requiring RL fine-tuning or large memory buffers. The key methodology involves using LLMs for inductive reasoning on environment trajectories to extract symbolic knowledge (action rules, knowledge/scene graphs), translating this into executable code rules, pruning redundant rules, and integrating these into an LLM world model within a Model-Predictive Control (MPC) loop. Results show significant improvements over baselines, including reward increases of 16.1%-51.6% in the Mars environment and achieving a 98% success rate in ALFWorld after only 4 iterations. For AI practitioners, this work demonstrates a training-free method to enhance LLM agent reliability and planning efficiency in novel or dynamic environments by explicitly learning and enforcing environment-specific constraints as verifiable code rules within the agent's world model. |
| MR. Video: "MapReduce" is the Principle for Long Video Understanding (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16082) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.16082))| Yu-Xiong Wang, Ziqi Pang | MR. Video proposes and validates the MapReduce principle for long video understanding, using an agentic framework to separate parallel short clip perception (Map) from joint information aggregation (Reduce). The objective is to overcome context length limitations of VLMs and the sequential, limited-context nature of existing video agents by applying this big data processing paradigm. The methodology involves a two-stage MapReduce workflow (Captioning and Analysis) implemented via an LLM agent controlling a VLM (Gemini-2.0-Flash) for perception and an LLM (GPT4o) for reasoning/reduction. MR. Video achieves 60.8% accuracy on the challenging LVBench dataset, demonstrating a >10% improvement over state-of-the-art VLMs and video agents, and correctly localizes relevant scenes for 68.8% of questions via its intention analysis step. For AI practitioners, this demonstrates that structuring long video analysis using the MapReduce principle enables scalable, parallel processing of local details and comprehensive global context aggregation, offering a practical method to improve performance on long-form video tasks. |
| Progent: Programmable Privilege Control for LLM Agents (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11703) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.11703))| Hongwei Li, Linyu Wu, Zhun Wang, Jingxuan He, stneng | Progent introduces a programmable framework using a domain-specific language (DSL) for fine-grained privilege control over LLM agent tool calls. The primary objective is to mitigate security risks associated with LLM agents executing potentially harmful actions via tools by enforcing the principle of least privilege. Key methodology involves a DSL, implemented using the JSON ecosystem, to define policies specifying permissible tool calls, conditions, and fallbacks, with support for manual definition and LLM-based automated generation/updating. Experimental results show Progent significantly enhances security, reducing attack success rates on the AgentDojo benchmark from 41.2% to 2.2% using combined manual and LLM-managed policies, while maintaining high utility. For AI practitioners, Progent offers a modular, API-based mechanism to integrate deterministic security controls into LLM agents, restricting tool use to essential functions and reducing vulnerabilities with minimal code modification. |
| RealisDance-DiT: Simple yet Strong Baseline towards Controllable
  Character Animation in the Wild (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14977) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.14977))| Chao Fan, Min Wei, Shikai Li, Yifan Wu, Jingkai Zhou | RealisDance-DiT introduces a simple yet strong baseline for controllable character animation in the wild by leveraging a powerful video foundation model with minimal modifications. The main objective is to address challenges in character animation such as rare poses, stylized characters, object interactions, and complex scenes without relying on elaborate, task-specific networks like Reference Net. The methodology involves making minor adjustments to the Wan-2.1 DiT architecture (adding condition layers, modifying RoPE) and employing specific fine-tuning strategies, namely low-noise warmup and large-batch/small-iteration training, to preserve foundation model priors while adapting to the animation task. Primary results show state-of-the-art performance, achieving an FVD of 563.28 and FID of 24.79 on the proposed RealisDance-Val benchmark, significantly outperforming prior methods. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that adapting large pre-trained foundation models with straightforward modifications and tailored fine-tuning can yield superior results for complex generative tasks compared to designing complex, specialized architectures from scratch. |
| IPBench: Benchmarking the Knowledge of Large Language Models in
  Intellectual Property (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15524) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.15524))| Minghui Zhu, Huaren Liu, Hongbo Wang, Guhong Chen, QiYao-Wang | This paper introduces IPBench, a comprehensive, bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate Large Language Model (LLM) knowledge across the complex intellectual property (IP) domain. The primary objective is to assess LLM capabilities in real-world IP scenarios involving both technical and legal understanding, covering 8 IP mechanisms and 20 distinct tasks. Methodologically, the benchmark comprises 10,374 data points used to evaluate 16 different LLMs, ranging from general-purpose to domain-specific models, under various prompting strategies. The key finding indicates substantial limitations, as the top-performing model (DeepSeek-V3) achieved only 75.8% overall accuracy, with open-source IP/law-oriented models notably underperforming compared to closed-source general models. For AI practitioners, this highlights the current gap in LLM proficiency for specialized IP tasks and suggests a need for enhanced domain-specific adaptation or fine-tuning, particularly for open-source solutions, to handle the required blend of technical and legal reasoning effectively. |
| CAPTURe: Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Vision Language Models via
  Occluded Object Counting (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15485) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.15485))| Mohit Bansal, Jaemin Cho, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Atin Pothiraj | This paper introduces CAPTURE, a benchmark to evaluate Vision Language Models' (VLMs) spatial reasoning by counting objects in patterns, especially when occluded. The primary objective is to quantify VLMs' ability to perform amodal counting by inferring patterns hidden behind occluders, testing their world modeling and spatial understanding. Methodology involves evaluating four VLMs (GPT-4o, Intern-VL2, Molmo, Qwen2-VL) on the CAPTURE dataset (real and synthetic images with occluded patterns) using the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE) metric, comparing performance on occluded versus unoccluded images and against human/object-detection baselines. Results show current VLMs struggle significantly, performing worse with occlusion (average sMAPE of 27.37% on CAPTUREreal occluded images versus 21.09% unoccluded), in stark contrast to near-perfect human performance (3.79% sMAPE occluded); providing oracle object coordinates substantially improves VLM performance, reducing error significantly (e.g., average VLM error dropped by 15.65% on CAPTUREreal when given all coordinates). For AI practitioners, this highlights that even strong VLMs lack robust spatial world modeling for occluded scenes, indicating their errors stem from both visual counting difficulties and an inability to infer missing information, suggesting limitations in current architectures for tasks requiring integrated visual reasoning and amodal completion. |
| DiffVox: A Differentiable Model for Capturing and Analysing Professional
  Effects Distributions (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14735) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.14735))| Wei-Hsiang Liao, Ben Hayes, Junghyun Koo, Marco A. Martínez-Ramírez, yoyolicoris | i) DiffVox presents a differentiable model for estimating and analysing professional vocal effects parameter distributions from audio data. ii) The research aims to capture real-world vocal processing configurations by reverse-engineering effects parameters using differentiable signal processing and analysing their statistical properties. iii) The methodology employs a differentiable audio effects chain (parametric EQ, dynamics, delay, FDN reverb) optimized via gradient descent using multi-resolution spectral (MRS) and loudness dynamic range (MLDR) losses on paired dry/wet vocal stems from two datasets. iv) Primary results demonstrate effective parameter fitting (e.g., DiffVox achieves MRS loss of 0.75/0.98 on left/right & mid/side channels for MedleyDB) and principal component analysis indicates the most significant variation (13.86% of variance on the internal dataset) corresponds to perceived spaciousness, with parameter distributions confirmed as non-Gaussian. v) For AI practitioners, this work offers a validated method and a public dataset of vocal presets to establish realistic priors for audio effects, potentially improving generative audio models and automatic mixing systems by replacing non-informative uniform or Gaussian assumptions. |

| Learning to Reason under Off-Policy Guidance (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14945) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.14945))| Zhi Wang, ganqu, huzican, yaful, Elliott | LUFFY introduces an off-policy guidance framework for reinforcement learning to enhance large reasoning model capabilities beyond purely on-policy methods. The primary objective is to effectively integrate external, high-quality reasoning traces (off-policy) with a model's own exploration (on-policy) within the zero-RL paradigm, overcoming limitations where models fail to acquire abilities beyond their initial scope. Key methodologies include mixed-policy training combining off-policy demonstrations with on-policy rollouts, and policy shaping via regularized importance sampling to dynamically balance imitation and exploration while mitigating entropy collapse. LUFFY demonstrates significant improvements, achieving an average gain of over +7.0 points across six math benchmarks compared to previous zero-RL methods and a +6.2 point advantage on out-of-distribution tasks. For AI practitioners, this work presents a validated technique to leverage off-policy data within RL, offering a scalable path to train more generalizable and capable reasoning models compared to standard supervised fine-tuning or purely on-policy RL. |

The primary objective is to create a meta-agent that designs a unique multi-agent workflow optimized for each individual user query, overcoming the rigidity of one-size-fits-all task-level systems. Key methodology involves initial supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on reasoning data distilled from a large model, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) using external code execution feedback and a multi-purpose reward signal encompassing performance, complexity, and efficiency. Results show FLOWREASONER-14B achieves 81.89% overall accuracy across three code benchmarks (BigCodeBench, HumanEval, MBPP), notably surpassing the o1-mini baseline by 10.52%. For AI practitioners, FLOWREASONER offers a method to automate the creation of adaptive multi-agent workflows tailored to specific user inputs, potentially improving performance and reducing manual engineering effort for complex, query-dependent tasks. |

  Vision-Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15271) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.15271))| WonminByeon, deahuang, lulidong, RealZhiqiLi, cg1177 | Eagle 2.5 is a vision-language model family improving long-context video and image understanding through specialized post-training and a new dataset. The research objective is to enhance vision-language models' capabilities for processing long-context multimodal inputs, specifically long videos and high-resolution images, without introducing specialized compression modules. Key methodologies include an information-first sampling strategy (combining Image Area Preservation tiling and Automatic Degradation Sampling for token budgeting), progressive post-training to scale context length (up to 128K), and the creation of the Eagle-Video-110K dataset using a dual (story-level and clip-level) annotation approach, built upon a SigLIP-Qwen2.5 architecture. Primary results show strong performance on long-context tasks; specifically, Eagle 2.5-8B achieves 72.4% accuracy on the Video-MME benchmark with 512 input frames, competitive with significantly larger proprietary and open-source models. For AI practitioners, this work provides validated techniques (information-first sampling, progressive training) and a dataset (Eagle-Video-110K) for developing smaller yet high-performing VLMs capable of processing extended visual contexts, crucial for applications involving long videos or detailed images. |
| ToolRL: Reward is All Tool Learning Needs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13958) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.13958))| Cheng Qian, Gokhantur, XtremSup, Merlin-Hongru, emrecanacikgoz | This paper presents a comprehensive study on reward design for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) tool use capabilities via Reinforcement Learning (RL). The main research objective is to systematically investigate and identify optimal reward strategies for tool selection and application tasks within the RL paradigm, assessing factors like reward type, scale, granularity, and temporal dynamics. The key methodology involves proposing a principled, fine-grained reward design tailored for tool use and training LLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), alongside extensive ablation studies on reward components. Empirical evaluations show this approach yields robust training, achieving a 17% improvement over base models and a 15% gain over Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) models on tool use benchmarks; specifically, fine-grained reward decomposition proved more effective than coarser signals. For AI practitioners, the principal implication is that careful, decomposed reward engineering within an RL framework is critical for developing LLMs with significantly enhanced and more generalizable tool-using abilities compared to SFT alone. |
| SphereDiff: Tuning-free Omnidirectional Panoramic Image and Video
  Generation via Spherical Latent Representation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14396) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.14396))| joyfull78, sungwon95, YeolJoo, TaewoongKang, mpark | SphereDiff introduces a tuning-free framework for generating seamless 360-degree panoramic images and videos by leveraging spherical latent representations with pre-trained diffusion models. The primary objective is to overcome the severe distortions and discontinuities, particularly near the poles, associated with traditional equirectangular projection (ERP) methods without requiring model fine-tuning. The methodology involves defining a uniform spherical latent representation, extending MultiDiffusion to this space, employing dynamic latent sampling to map spherical latents to a 2D grid compatible with standard diffusion models, and using distortion-aware weighted averaging during projection. SphereDiff demonstrates superior performance over baselines, achieving significantly higher scores for distortion mitigation (e.g., 3.238 vs. 2.854 for DynamicScaler) and end-to-end continuity (e.g., 4.892 vs. 3.985) in image generation tasks. For AI practitioners, this provides a robust, tuning-free approach to generate high-quality omnidirectional content directly from existing perspective-view diffusion models, bypassing the need for ERP-specific datasets and mitigating common projection artifacts. |

  3D Gaussians (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15281) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.15281))| Cailin Zhuang, Yiying12, unpackableorange, wchengad, xuanyangz | StyleMe3D introduces a multi-encoder framework using disentangled priors for high-quality artistic stylization of 3D Gaussian Splatting representations. The primary objective is to enable versatile and coherent style transfer onto pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting models while preserving geometric integrity and overcoming limitations of prior methods in handling stylized aesthetics. Key methodology involves integrating four novel components—Dynamic Style Score Distillation (DSSD) using Stable Diffusion's latent space, Contrastive Style Descriptor (CSD), Simultaneously Optimized Scale (SOS) via VGG features, and a 3D Gaussian Quality Assessment (3DG-QA) prior—while optimizing only the RGB attributes of the Gaussians. StyleMe3D demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher quantitative metrics (e.g., PSNR 18.015, SSIM 0.830, LPIPS 0.174 on evaluated datasets) and preserving fine geometric details and stylistic consistency. For AI practitioners, this work provides a robust method to apply diverse artistic styles to existing 3D GS assets, significantly enhancing visual content for gaming, virtual worlds, and digital art by effectively bridging photorealistic reconstruction with artistic expression without altering underlying geometry. |
| X-Teaming: Multi-Turn Jailbreaks and Defenses with Adaptive Multi-Agents (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13203) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.13203))| hamidpalangi, mparvez, genglinliu, liweijiang, salmannyu | X-Teaming introduces an adaptive multi-agent framework for systematic multi-turn language model jailbreaking and defense generation. The main objective is to address the gap in multi-turn conversational AI safety by exploring how harmless interactions escalate into harmful outcomes and generating diverse attack scenarios. Key methodology involves a two-phase approach using collaborative agents: a Planner for strategy, an Attacker for execution, a Verifier for evaluation, and a Prompt Optimizer using TextGrad for refining failed attacks. Primary results show state-of-the-art multi-turn jailbreak effectiveness, achieving attack success rates up to 98.1% across various models, including 96.2% against Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and the creation of the 30K-example XGuard-Train dataset.

| UFO2: The Desktop AgentOS (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14603) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.14603))| rujiawang, liqul, duchao, shilhe, vyokky | UFO2 presents a multiagent AgentOS deeply integrated with Windows for robust LLM-driven desktop automation. The objective is to build a practical, system-level automation framework that overcomes the limitations of prior CUAs reliant on shallow OS integration and screenshot-based interaction. Methodology involves a `HOSTAGENT` for orchestration, application-specific `APPAGENTS` leveraging native APIs and domain knowledge, a hybrid UIA-vision control detection pipeline, a unified GUI-API action layer, speculative multi-action execution, and a Picture-in-Picture interface for non-disruptive operation. Key results demonstrate superior performance over existing CUAs, achieving up to 32.7% success rate on the OSWorld-W benchmark (o1 model); API integration improved completion rates by over 8%, and speculative execution reduced LLM inference calls by up to 51.5% on certain tasks without degrading success rate. For AI practitioners, this work highlights that deep OS integration and hybrid GUI-API interaction models are critical for moving desktop automation agents from conceptual prototypes to reliable, efficient, and scalable real-world applications. |

The objective is to address the lack of reasoning-focused coding benchmarks and provide a self-contained, contamination-free testbed for training and evaluation. The methodology involved collecting 2,869 LeetCode problems with metadata, 100+ test cases per problem, canonical solutions, and applying a strict temporal split (pre/post-July 2024) for training and test sets. Results demonstrate that reasoning models significantly outperform non-reasoning ones (DeepSeek-R1 achieved 65.23% pass@1 on the test set), and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using only 2.6K model-generated examples from the dataset achieved performance comparable to models trained on 110K examples. For AI practitioners, this dataset provides a reliable resource for evaluating code generation models without contamination and highlights the potential for highly data-efficient SFT using curated, high-quality problem-solution pairs. |

  MLLMs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15280) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.15280))| Shengbang Tong, yubei, chengtim, ch-chenyu, danielchyeh | Here is a 4-sentence summary of the research paper:  This paper introduces All-Angles Bench, a new benchmark with over 2,100 question-answer pairs across 90 scenes, designed to evaluate the multi-view scene understanding capabilities of Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The primary objective is to assess how well MLLMs reconcile geometric consistency and cross-view correspondence across diverse viewpoints using six defined tasks, including attribute identification and camera pose estimation. Experiments on 27 MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-Flash, InternVL2.5-38B) reveal a significant performance gap compared to humans (human 82.0% vs. best MLLM 60.8% on a 250 Q&A subset), with particular weaknesses in handling partial occlusions and estimating coarse camera poses. For AI practitioners, this implies that current MLLMs require substantial improvements, likely through domain-specific training or architectural changes incorporating multi-view awareness, to be reliably deployed in applications demanding 3D scene comprehension like embodied agents. |

| LearnAct: Few-Shot Mobile GUI Agent with a Unified Demonstration
  Benchmark (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13805) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.13805))| dkeeeee, Yuxiang007, zhimingc, Pengxiangzhao, lgy0404 | This paper presents LearnAct, a few-shot learning framework, and LearnGUI, a benchmark, to improve mobile GUI agent generalization using human demonstrations. The primary objective is to enhance mobile GUI agent capabilities in handling diverse, unseen scenarios and user-specific tasks by learning from a small number of examples, addressing limitations of traditional pre-training or large-scale fine-tuning. The key methodology involves the LearnAct multi-agent framework (DemoParser for knowledge extraction, KnowSeeker for retrieval, ActExecutor for execution) and the LearnGUI benchmark dataset containing offline/online tasks with human demonstrations and similarity metrics. Primary results demonstrate significant performance gains; notably, a single demonstration improved Gemini-1.5-Pro's offline accuracy from 19.3% to 51.7%, and LearnAct boosted UI-TARS-7B-SFT's online success rate from 18.1% to 32.8%. For AI practitioners, this work implies that incorporating few-shot demonstration-based learning is a viable strategy to create more adaptable and deployable mobile GUI agents, reducing reliance on extensive datasets for personalization and handling long-tail tasks. |
| LookingGlass: Generative Anamorphoses via Laplacian Pyramid Warping (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08902) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.08902))| Vinicius C. Azevedo, Jingwei Tang, coffeeweb2907, ssancho, pascalchang87 | This paper introduces LookingGlass, a method using latent rectified flow models and a novel Laplacian Pyramid Warping technique to generate anamorphic images that reveal hidden content via specific viewpoints while maintaining a valid direct interpretation. The objective is to extend generative optical illusions to latent space models and complex spatial transformations beyond simple orthogonal warps, using only text prompts. The core methodology involves synchronizing latent flow model predictions across views by decoding to image space, applying frequency-aware Laplacian Pyramid Warping (LPW) for robust transformation and blending, encoding back to latent space, and using residual correction. Primary results demonstrate high-quality anamorphosis generation for conic/cylindrical mirrors and Nicéron's lens, quantitatively outperforming prior methods on complex transforms (e.g., achieving FID 129.74 vs 166.03+ for 135° rotation). For AI practitioners, this work presents a feed-forward approach for creating intricate perceptual illusions with modern latent generative models and introduces LPW, a generally applicable technique for high-fidelity, frequency-aware image warping in generative tasks. |
| DRAGON: Distributional Rewards Optimize Diffusion Generative Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15217) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.15217))| Somayeh Sojoudi, Jonah Casebeer, Njb, Bai-YT | DRAGON introduces a versatile on-policy framework for fine-tuning diffusion models using distributional rewards beyond standard instance-level feedback. The objective is to enable optimization for a wider class of reward functions, including instance-wise, instance-to-distribution, and distribution-to-distribution metrics, such as FAD or Vendi diversity. DRAGON operates by generating on-policy samples, evaluating them with the target reward function to construct positive (D+) and negative (D-) demonstration sets, and then applying contrastive optimization losses (like Diffusion-DPO/KTO) to align the model's output distribution. Experiments fine-tuning a text-to-music model showed DRAGON achieved an 81.45% average win rate across 20 diverse reward functions, and significantly improved human-perceived quality (60.95% human-voted win rate) by optimizing FAD with an appropriate exemplar set, without needing human preference annotations. For AI practitioners, DRAGON provides a method to directly optimize generative models for complex distributional metrics like FAD and enables using easily obtainable reference data (even cross-modal, like text descriptions for music) to improve generation quality, reducing reliance on costly human feedback collection. |

  for Video Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14899) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.14899))| Shikai Li, yanweifuture, Alex-snow, theFoxofSky, ewrfcas | Uni3C introduces a unified framework for precise 3D-enhanced camera and human motion control in video generation using foundational video diffusion models (VDMs). The objective is to enable joint, precise control over both camera trajectories and human motions in video generation, overcoming limitations of separate controls and reliance on jointly annotated data. Key methodologies include PCDController, a lightweight, plug-and-play module trained with a frozen VDM backbone using unprojected point clouds for camera control, and a global 3D world guidance system aligning scenic point clouds and SMPL-X characters for unified inference. Uni3C significantly improves joint control, achieving an Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) of 0.251 on the unified benchmark, substantially outperforming the baseline RealisDance-DiT's ATE of 0.549 while maintaining visual quality.

The objective is to improve long-term 3D point tracking accuracy and robustness, particularly under complex deformations and large camera movements, by leveraging persistent 3D world-space representations. The methodology involves lifting 2D video features using depth and optional camera pose into a 3D point feature cloud (world or camera coordinates), employing a novel Local Pair Attention mechanism for contextualization, and iteratively refining 3D trajectories via a transformer. Results show state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming prior methods; for example, on the LSFOdyssey benchmark using ground-truth depth and camera pose, TAPIP3D-world achieved 72.2 AJ3D compared to 37.7 AJ3D for the DELTA baseline. For AI practitioners, this work demonstrates that utilizing explicit 3D world-space coordinates and 3D-specific attention mechanisms can yield substantial improvements in tracking accuracy for applications requiring fine-grained motion understanding, especially when reliable depth and pose are accessible. |

The primary objective is to generalize RL-enhanced reasoning capabilities to diverse non-math domains (STEM, humanities, social sciences) where verifiable reward structures are less defined than in mathematics. The methodology involves curating multi-source QA data, applying structured answer templates (MCQ/Open-Ended), filtering for verifiability, optimizing data blending ratios, and employing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for RL training. This framework achieved substantial accuracy gains over baselines on both math (MATH-500: +30.1%) and non-math benchmarks (MMLU-PRO: +12.8%), with the multi-domain blend notably improving response efficiency by using 28% fewer tokens for correct general-purpose reasoning answers compared to a math-only RL model. For AI practitioners, the principal implication is that incorporating diverse, multi-domain data with appropriate formatting and filtering into RL pipelines is crucial for enhancing LLM reasoning generalization and inference efficiency, moving beyond math-centric training paradigms. |
| CoMotion: Concurrent Multi-person 3D Motion (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12186) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.12186))| Stephan R. Richter, Alejandro Newell, vkoltun, lahavl, peiyun-hu-apple | CoMotion introduces an online approach for concurrent 3D pose estimation and tracking of multiple people from a single monocular video stream. The primary objective is to maintain temporally coherent and accurate 3D pose tracks for multiple individuals, even in crowded scenes with occlusions, in a streaming fashion. The methodology employs a recurrent model using a tracking-by-attention paradigm, directly updating existing pose tracks from image features via cross-attention and a GRU, alongside a module for detecting new tracks, trained on a heterogeneous mix of real and synthetic datasets with pseudo-labels. CoMotion achieves state-of-the-art pose accuracy and significantly improves tracking, notably increasing MOTA by 14% and IDF1 by 12% on PoseTrack21 over prior methods while being substantially faster. For AI practitioners, this demonstrates that directly updating tracks from image features enables more robust and efficient online multi-person 3D motion tracking compared to traditional detect-and-associate methods. |

| Does Reinforcement Learning Really Incentivize Reasoning Capacity in
  LLMs Beyond the Base Model? (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13837) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.13837))| Zhaokai Wang, Andrew Zhao, Rui Lu, Zhiqi Chen, Yang Yue | This paper demonstrates that Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) primarily enhances sampling efficiency for existing reasoning paths within LLMs, rather than fundamentally expanding reasoning capacity beyond the base model. The study critically investigates if RLVR enables LLMs to acquire novel reasoning abilities exceeding their base models' intrinsic capabilities. Using the `pass@k` metric with large `k` values across math, coding, and visual reasoning benchmarks, alongside perplexity analysis and manual Chain-of-Thought checks, the researchers compared the reasoning boundaries of base and RL-trained models. Key findings reveal that while RL models excel at low `k` (pass@1), base models consistently match or surpass RL models at high `k` (e.g., base Minerva 32B outperformed its RL counterpart by ~9% pass@128), indicating RL primarily learns to sample pre-existing correct reasoning paths more efficiently, rather than discovering new ones. For AI practitioners, this implies current RLVR mainly optimizes known reasoning patterns rather than fostering new skills, suggesting that achieving breakthroughs in reasoning might require complementary methods like distillation or fundamentally different training paradigms that overcome RL's observed limitation in narrowing exploration. |
| MIG: Automatic Data Selection for Instruction Tuning by Maximizing
  Information Gain in Semantic Space (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13835) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.13835))| Haochen Ye, Zerun Ma, Kai Hu, Yining Li, Yicheng Chen | This paper introduces MIG, an automatic method for selecting instruction-tuning data by maximizing information gain within a semantic label graph representation. Its objective is to unify the quantification of data quality and diversity for efficient subset selection from large pools, overcoming limitations of prior heuristic and embedding-based techniques. MIG models semantic relationships via a label graph, uses a submodular information function considering propagation effects, and iteratively selects samples via a greedy, gain-maximizing algorithm. Key results demonstrate MIG's superiority over baselines; notably, Llama3.1-8B tuned with just 5% of Tulu3 data selected by MIG improved performance over the model trained on the full dataset by +5.73% on AlpacaEval and +6.89% on Wildbench. This provides AI practitioners an efficient, automated approach to curate smaller yet highly effective instruction-tuning datasets, potentially reducing training costs while improving model alignment and outperforming methods relying solely on embedding distance or heuristics. |
| Could Thinking Multilingually Empower LLM Reasoning? (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11833) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.11833))| Lei Li, Shujian Huang, Wenhao Zhu, Xu Huang, Changjiang Gao | This paper investigates harnessing multilingualism to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning capabilities. The primary objective is to quantify the potential performance upper-bound of multilingual reasoning compared to English-only approaches. Key methodology involves aggregating LLM responses (LLaMA3.1-70B, Qwen2.5-72B, R1-distill-LLaMA3.1-70B) to parallel inputs translated into 17 languages on GPQA and MGSM datasets, measuring the Acc@k upper bound. Results demonstrate that multilingual thinking significantly surpasses English-only baselines (Repeat/Paraphrase), boosting the Acc@k upper bound by nearly 10 points (e.g., GPQA from ~45 to ~90 Acc@17). For AI practitioners, this highlights substantial untapped potential in leveraging diverse languages for reasoning, though current answer selection methods (majority voting, prompt-based, LLM-as-judge) fail to fully realize this potential gain. |
| AerialMegaDepth: Learning Aerial-Ground Reconstruction and View
  Synthesis (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13157) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.13157))| Shubham Tulsiani, Srinivasa Narasimhan, Deva Ramanan, Anurag Ghosh, kvuong2711 | This paper introduces AerialMegaDepth, a hybrid dataset for improving aerial-ground 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. The objective is to overcome the failure of learning-based methods to handle extreme viewpoint variations between aerial and ground images due to a lack of suitable training data. The methodology combines pseudo-synthetic aerial renderings from 3D city meshes (Google Earth) with co-registered real ground-level images (MegaDepth) into a unified coordinate system. Fine-tuning the DUSt3R model on AerialMegaDepth significantly improved ground-aerial camera registration, increasing the Relative Rotation Accuracy @5° from under 5% to nearly 56%. AI practitioners can utilize this framework and dataset to develop models robust to drastic viewpoint differences for tasks like cross-view 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, addressing a key limitation in existing large-scale datasets. |
| HiScene: Creating Hierarchical 3D Scenes with Isometric View Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13072) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.13072))| Tao Hu, Yuan Li, Zesong Yang, Bangbang Yang, Wenqi Dong | HiScene introduces a hierarchical framework for generating editable, compositional 3D scenes from text prompts by leveraging isometric view generation. The main objective is to create high-fidelity 3D scenes with natural layouts, complete object instances, and interactive editing capabilities, overcoming limitations of prior methods. Its methodology involves initializing a scene from an isometric view using a native 3D generator, performing hierarchical scene parsing with 3D segmentation, applying video-diffusion-based amodal completion to handle occlusions, and using spatial alignment with shape prior injection for object regeneration. Experimental results show HiScene outperforms methods like GALA3D and DreamScene in user studies (Overall Quality score: 2.76 vs 1.75/1.73) and metrics, with its amodal completion achieving 83.84 mIoU on COCO-A, surpassing prior zero-shot methods. This research provides AI practitioners with a method to generate complex, editable 3D scenes from text, improving workflow for interactive applications, and introduces a robust video-diffusion technique for amodal completion relevant to 3D perception. |
| NodeRAG: Structuring Graph-based RAG with Heterogeneous Nodes (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11544) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.11544))| Yixin Liu, Haoxiang Chen, Chengze Li, Haojie Zheng, Tianyang Xu | This paper introduces NodeRAG, a framework optimizing retrieval-augmented generation by structuring knowledge into a carefully designed heterogeneous graph with distinct node types. The main objective is to demonstrate how this specific graph structure enhances graph-based RAG performance, particularly for multi-hop reasoning and summary-level queries, compared to methods with less considered structures. NodeRAG utilizes LLMs to decompose text into seven distinct node types (Entity, Relationship, Semantic Unit, Attribute, High-Level, Overview, Text), augments the graph via community detection and node importance metrics, and employs graph algorithms like shallow Personalized PageRank with a dual (exact + vector) search for retrieval. Primarily, NodeRAG achieves superior accuracy on multi-hop benchmarks, such as 46.29% on MuSiQue (compared to 41.71% for GraphRAG), while using fewer retrieval tokens. For AI practitioners, NodeRAG provides a concrete methodology for designing graph indices that yield more precise, efficient, and explainable retrieval, significantly improving RAG system performance and reducing operational costs associated with token usage for complex information synthesis tasks. |

  Attentional Bias, Retention, and Online Optimization (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13173) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.13173))| Vahab Mirrokni, Peilin Zhong, Meisam Razaviyayn, Ali Behrouz | This paper reconceptualizes sequence models like Transformers and linear RNNs as associative memory modules optimizing an internal "attentional bias" objective, introducing the MIRAS framework. The main objective is to define an underlying design framework for these models by integrating concepts of associative memory, attentional bias, retention mechanisms, and online optimization. Key methodology involves proposing MIRAS, characterized by four design choices (memory architecture, attentional bias, retention gate, memory algorithm), and developing three new models (MONETA, YAAD, MEMORA) using novel biases (e.g., lp-loss, Huber) and retention gates (e.g., Lq, KL divergence). Primary results demonstrate that these MIRAS variants outperform state-of-the-art baselines on language modeling, commonsense reasoning, and recall tasks, with the 1.3B parameter YAAD model achieving 15.18 perplexity on Wikitext compared to 18.53 for Transformer++. For AI practitioners, the principal implication is that MIRAS offers a structured method to design sequence backbones by explicitly selecting attentional bias and retention mechanisms beyond standard L2/dot-product approaches, enabling targeted optimization for tasks demanding specific capabilities like long-context handling or robustness. |
| Tokenize Image Patches: Global Context Fusion for Effective Haze Removal
  in Large Images (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09621) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.09621))| Kaiqi Li, Qizhi Xu, Jiuchen Chen, fengyanzi | This paper introduces DehazeXL, an efficient end-to-end method for removing haze from large, high-resolution images by balancing global context and local features. The main objective is to overcome GPU memory limitations typically encountered when processing large images for dehazing, without resorting to performance-degrading slicing or downsampling. DehazeXL partitions the input image into patches, encodes them locally, fuses global context using an efficient global attention bottleneck inspired by large language models, and decodes patches asynchronously in mini-batches. Key results demonstrate that DehazeXL can process images up to 10240x10240 pixels using only 21 GB of GPU memory (FP16 inference), achieving state-of-the-art PSNR (32.35) and SSIM (0.9863) on the introduced 8KDehaze dataset. For AI practitioners, the primary implication is a validated, memory-efficient architecture enabling the application of complex image restoration models to ultra-high-resolution inputs on mainstream hardware, crucial for remote sensing or surveillance applications. |
| Thought Manipulation: External Thought Can Be Efficient for Large
  Reasoning Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13626) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.13626))| Wenhan Dong, Zifan Peng, Zhen Sun, Jingyi Zheng, Yule Liu | This paper introduces ThoughtMani, a training-free pipeline using external Chain-of-Thought (CoT) from smaller models to improve the inference efficiency of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). The main objective is to mitigate LRM "overthinking" and reduce computational costs by bypassing unnecessary reasoning steps without fine-tuning. The core methodology involves inserting CoTs generated by a smaller model between specific thinking tokens (`<think>`, `</think>`) in the LRM's prompt to guide its generation. Key results demonstrate significant efficiency gains; for example, applying ThoughtMani to QwQ-32B on LiveBench/Code reduced output token counts by approximately 30% while maintaining performance and improving safety alignment by an average of 10%. For AI practitioners, ThoughtMani provides a practical, low-overhead method to make LRMs more computationally efficient and accessible for real-world applications, particularly when deploying different model sizes concurrently. |

| CLIMB: CLustering-based Iterative Data Mixture Bootstrapping for
  Language Model Pre-training (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13161) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.13161))| Dan Su, Xin Dong, Yonggan Fu, Yu Yang, shizhediao | CLIMB introduces an automated framework using clustering and iterative bootstrapping to optimize language model pre-training data mixtures. The main objective is to automatically discover, evaluate, and refine optimal data mixtures from large-scale corpora without manual curation or predefined domain labels to improve pre-training performance. The methodology involves embedding and clustering documents, followed by an iterative process that samples mixture configurations, trains proxy models, fits a performance predictor, and prunes the search space to find optimal weights. Primary results show that a 1B model trained continuously on 400B tokens using the CLIMB-optimized mixture (ClimbMix) surpassed the Llama-3.2-1B model by 2.0% on average across 12 reasoning benchmarks. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that CLIMB provides a data-driven, automated approach to curate high-quality pre-training datasets from unlabeled web-scale data, demonstrably improving model performance under fixed token budgets compared to baseline mixtures or random sampling, as evidenced by the released ClimbMix dataset. |
| Antidistillation Sampling (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13146) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.13146))| Avi Schwarzschild, Zhili Feng, Asher Trockman, arobey1, yashsavani | This paper introduces antidistillation sampling, a technique to generate reasoning traces from large language models (LLMs) that hinder model distillation while maintaining the original model's performance. The primary objective is to develop a sampling strategy that poisons generated data for distillation purposes, thereby protecting proprietary model capabilities, without sacrificing the utility of the model's outputs for downstream tasks. The key methodology involves modifying the teacher model's next-token sampling distribution by adding a penalty term proportional to an approximation of how a sampled token would increase a proxy student model's downstream loss, calculated efficiently via a finite difference approximation of a directional derivative. Results show that for comparable teacher model accuracy on GSM8K (around 68-69%), antidistillation sampling reduced the distilled student model's accuracy to 24.73%, significantly lower than the 51.86% achieved by a student distilled from traces generated via standard temperature sampling. For AI practitioners, this method offers a way to protect intellectual property embedded in frontier models by degrading the effectiveness of distillation when sharing model outputs, such as extended reasoning traces, while largely preserving the original model's task performance. |
| A Strategic Coordination Framework of Small LLMs Matches Large LLMs in
  Data Synthesis (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12322) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.12322))| Honglin Lin, Yu Li, Zinan Tang, Qizhi Pei, GX-XinGao | A coordination framework (GRA) using multiple small LLMs achieves data synthesis quality comparable to single large LLMs. The research objective is to design a resource-efficient framework enabling small LLMs to collectively match the data synthesis capabilities of monolithic LLMs without their associated high costs and limitations. GRA employs a peer-review-inspired methodology assigning distinct Generator, Reviewer, and Adjudicator roles to multiple small LLMs for iterative data generation, evaluation, and quality control. Primary results show GRA-produced data matches or surpasses large LLM quality; data synthesized using GRA with a Qwen-2.5-7B base model outperformed Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct distilled data by 8.83% on average across tested benchmarks. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that strategically coordinating smaller models offers a computationally efficient alternative for generating high-quality synthetic training data, reducing reliance on large models for data synthesis and distillation. |
| Packing Input Frame Context in Next-Frame Prediction Models for Video
  Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12626) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.12626))| Maneesh Agrawala, Lvmin Zhang | This paper presents FramePack, a structure for next-frame video prediction that compresses input frames to maintain a fixed transformer context length. The primary objective is to mitigate the "forgetting" (fading memory) and "drifting" (error accumulation) problems in generating long videos. FramePack employs progressive compression using varying transformer patchify kernel sizes based on frame importance and introduces anti-drifting sampling methods like inverted temporal ordering for bi-directional context. Results show that finetuning existing models with FramePack, especially using the inverted anti-drifting sampling (e.g., f1k1\_x\_g9\_f1k1f2k2f16k4\_td configuration), achieves superior performance across multiple metrics, including the highest human assessment ELO score of 1239 in ablation studies. For AI practitioners, FramePack offers a method to train video generation models capable of handling longer sequences with significantly higher batch sizes and reduced error accumulation, potentially improving visual quality and training efficiency. |

  with Retrospective Resampling (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13169) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.13169))| Trevor Darrell, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Jiaxin Ge, Heekyung Lee, tsunghanwu | This paper introduces REVERSE, a unified framework reducing visual hallucinations in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) via hallucination-aware training and retrospective resampling. The objective is to enable a single VLM to both detect and dynamically correct its own hallucinations during text generation, unifying generation adjustment and post-hoc verification. Key methodology involves fine-tuning VLMs on a new 1.3M semi-synthetic dataset annotated with confidence tokens (</CN>, </UN>) and employing inference-time retrospective resampling triggered by token uncertainty to backtrack and regenerate content. Primary results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to a 12% reduction in CHAIR scores on CHAIR-MSCOCO compared to previous best methods. For AI practitioners, REVERSE offers a novel technique to enhance VLM reliability by embedding self-verification and correction capabilities directly into the model, reducing reliance on external verifiers or complex multi-stage pipelines. |
| WORLDMEM: Long-term Consistent World Simulation with Memory (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12369) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.12369))| Shuai Yang, Wenqi Ouyang, Yifan Zhou, Yushi Lan, Zeqi Xiao | WORLDMEM introduces a memory-augmented framework for long-term consistent world simulation, addressing temporal limitations in existing video diffusion models. The primary research objective is to mitigate the lack of long-term 3D spatial consistency in generative world simulators caused by limited temporal context windows. The methodology integrates an external memory bank (storing past frames with pose and timestamp states) into a Conditional Diffusion Transformer, using memory attention with relative state embeddings (Plücker for pose) and Diffusion Forcing to condition generation on retrieved memories. Quantitative results demonstrate improved consistency; for instance, on a Minecraft benchmark beyond the context window, WORLDMEM achieved a PSNR of 25.32 and LPIPS of 0.1429, significantly outperforming a Diffusion Forcing baseline (PSNR 18.04, LPIPS 0.4376). For AI practitioners, this approach offers a method to build more persistent and spatially coherent interactive simulations or virtual environments where maintaining state over extended periods is critical. |
| VistaDPO: Video Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Direct Preference
  Optimization for Large Video Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13122) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.13122))| Meng Luo, Haojian Huang, scofield7419, ChocoWu, Harold328 | VistaDPO introduces a hierarchical spatial-temporal direct preference optimization framework to enhance large video models (LVMs). The primary objective is to address LVM misalignment with human intuition and video hallucination by optimizing text-video preference alignment across instance, temporal, and perceptive hierarchical levels. The key methodology involves applying this hierarchical DPO framework, termed VistaDPO, using a newly constructed VistaDPO-7k dataset (7.2K QA pairs) annotated with chosen/rejected responses and spatial-temporal grounding information. Experimental results show VistaDPO significantly improves baseline LVMs, achieving average performance gains of 26.42% over PLLaVA and 53.92% over Video-LLaVA across hallucination, QA, and captioning benchmarks. For AI practitioners, this work demonstrates that incorporating hierarchical spatial-temporal preference optimization, beyond simple instance-level DPO, is crucial for improving the reliability and reducing hallucinations in LVMs for complex video understanding tasks. |
| NoisyRollout: Reinforcing Visual Reasoning with Data Augmentation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13055) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.13055))| Chao Du, Zijian Wu, Jinjie Ni, Xiangyan Liu, dreamerdeo | NoisyRollout introduces an RL fine-tuning approach for VLMs that enhances visual reasoning by incorporating trajectories from distorted images during rollout collection. The objective is to improve policy exploration diversity and mitigate issues arising from imperfect visual perception in VLMs without additional training costs. The key methodology involves a hybrid rollout strategy within GRPO, using both clean and noise-distorted images (with noise annealing) to generate trajectories for reward calculation, while policy updates use only clean images. Using just 2.1K samples, NoisyRollout achieved state-of-the-art average accuracy of 59.2% across five out-of-domain benchmarks compared to similar open-source RL-tuned models. For AI practitioners, this work demonstrates that targeted data augmentation during RL rollouts can effectively boost VLM generalization and robustness, particularly for visual reasoning, offering a cost-effective method to enhance exploration. |

  Answering (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05506) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.05506))| Firoz Kabir, Aayush Bajaj, Mahir Ahmed, 38saidul, ahmed-masry | This paper introduces ChartQAPro, a diverse and challenging benchmark for Chart Question Answering (CQA). The primary objective was to address the limitations of existing CQA benchmarks, such as lack of diversity and performance saturation, and provide a more realistic evaluation of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). The authors constructed ChartQAPro by collecting 1,341 charts from 157 diverse sources, including infographics and dashboards, paired with 1,948 human-verified questions covering multiple complex types like conversational and hypothetical queries. Evaluations on 21 LVLMs revealed a substantial performance decrease on ChartQAPro compared to prior benchmarks; for instance, Claude Sonnet 3.5's accuracy dropped from 90.5% on ChartQA to 55.81% on ChartQAPro. For AI practitioners, this implies that current LVLMs struggle significantly with complex, real-world chart reasoning, and ChartQAPro serves as a more robust tool for identifying these limitations and guiding future model development. |
| Exploring Expert Failures Improves LLM Agent Tuning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13145) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.13145))| Ruochen Wang, Minhao Cheng, Andrew Bai, Li-Cheng Lan, zhoutianyi | This paper introduces Exploring Expert Failures (EEF), a fine-tuning method that improves LLM agent performance by utilizing information from failed expert trajectories. The objective is to address the limitation of Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT), which discards failed expert trajectories, causing agents to struggle with complex, out-of-distribution subtasks where experts often fail. EEF simulates intermediate states from failed expert trajectories using the current agent policy, identifies beneficial action sequences leading to success via simulation, and selectively incorporates only these validated segments into the training data for supervised fine-tuning. The primary result shows EEF achieved a 62% win rate on the WebShop benchmark, significantly outperforming RFT (53.6%) and setting a new state-of-the-art score above 0.81. For AI practitioners, this implies that analyzing and selectively leveraging segments from *failed* expert demonstrations, rather than discarding them entirely, provides valuable training signals that enhance agent capabilities on complex tasks and improve overall tuning efficiency. |

The primary objective is to address the limited generalization, compromised image quality, and reduced textual controllability inherent in previous U-Net based or optimization-based character customization approaches, especially when applied to large Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). Methodologically, it introduces a scalable adapter with stacked transformer encoders, integrating features from SigLIP and DINOv2 via dual-stream fusion and a timestep-aware Q-former, trained progressively in three stages on a 10-million sample dataset containing paired and unpaired character images. Qualitative results demonstrate superior performance in maintaining character identity, fidelity, and text controllability compared to prior art like OminiControl, EasyControl, ACE++, and UNO, achieving comparable results to GPT4o, though specific quantitative metrics are not detailed in the provided text. For AI practitioners, this research offers a robust architecture and training strategy for adapting large foundation DiT models to specialized, controllable generation tasks like character personalization, enhancing flexibility and output quality without requiring test-time fine-tuning. |
| CCMNet: Leveraging Calibrated Color Correction Matrices for Cross-Camera
  Color Constancy (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07959) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.07959))| Seon Joo Kim, Michael S. Brown, Dongyun Kim, Mahmoud Afifi, dongyong2 | CCMNet introduces a lightweight framework utilizing pre-calibrated Color Correction Matrices (CCMs) for zero-shot cross-camera color constancy. The objective is to enable accurate illuminant estimation on unseen cameras without retraining or needing additional test images. The methodology involves using CCMs to map standard illuminants to the camera's raw space, encoding this trajectory into a Camera Fingerprint Embedding (CFE) via a CNN, and using this CFE to guide a hypernetwork (based on CCC/C5) for predicting illumination from uv-histograms; imaginary camera augmentation further improves robustness. CCMNet achieves state-of-the-art results, such as a 1.68° mean angular error on Cube+, outperforming previous methods while being computationally efficient. For AI practitioners, this provides a method to achieve consistent color rendering across diverse camera hardware by leveraging readily available ISP metadata (CCMs), eliminating the need for per-camera calibration data or model fine-tuning. |
| FocusedAD: Character-centric Movie Audio Description (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12157) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.12157))| Liangcheng Li, Sheng Zhou, Yiren Song, Chun Wang, Xiaojun Ye | FocusedAD introduces a novel framework for generating character-centric movie audio descriptions (AD) emphasizing narrative relevance. The main objective is to automatically produce AD for movies that explicitly identifies characters by name and focuses on plot-significant visual details, unlike generic video captioning. The methodology integrates a Character Perception Module (CPM) using an automated clustering-based query bank for character identification/tracking, a Dynamic Prior Module (DPM) injecting context via soft prompts, and a Focused Caption Module (FCM) generating descriptions from scene, character, and text tokens. FocusedAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, including a BertScore of 57.7 on MAD-eval-Named and 64.5 on the introduced Cinepile-AD dataset, significantly outperforming prior AD methods and general MLLMs. For AI practitioners, this work provides a method for enhancing MLLM-based video understanding by incorporating specialized modules for character focus and contextual integration, leading to more narratively coherent and targeted outputs relevant for accessibility tools. |
| Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Conflicting Evidence (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13079) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.13079))| Mohit Bansal, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Archiki Prasad, HanNight | This paper introduces RAMDocs, a dataset for evaluating RAG systems against simultaneous ambiguity, misinformation, and noise, and proposes MADAM-RAG, a multi-agent debate framework to handle such conflicts. The main objective is to develop and evaluate a RAG approach capable of managing diverse, concurrent sources of conflict in retrieved documents, a common challenge in real-world scenarios. The key methodology involves assigning individual documents to LLM agents who debate their validity over multiple rounds, followed by an aggregator agent synthesizing a final response based on the discussion. MADAM-RAG significantly outperforms strong RAG baselines, improving accuracy by up to 11.40% on AmbigDocs and 15.80% on FaithEval using Llama3.3-70B-Instruct, while the new RAMDocs dataset proves challenging for existing methods. For AI practitioners, this indicates that standard RAG pipelines are insufficient for handling complex, realistic conflicts, and multi-agent debate frameworks like MADAM-RAG are needed to improve the reliability and factuality of RAG outputs when facing ambiguity, misinformation, and noise simultaneously. |
| Sleep-time Compute: Beyond Inference Scaling at Test-time (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13171) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.13171))| Sarah Wooders, Charles Packer, Yu Wang, Charlie Snell, Kevin Lin | This paper introduces sleep-time compute, a technique allowing LLMs to pre-process context offline to reduce test-time compute requirements. The research aims to evaluate the efficacy of sleep-time compute in improving the accuracy vs. test-time compute trade-off for stateful reasoning tasks. The methodology involves modifying reasoning datasets (GSM-Symbolic, AIME) into stateful versions where context is processed during "sleep-time" before a query arrives, comparing this to standard test-time scaling. Key results show sleep-time compute reduces the test-time compute needed for equivalent accuracy by approximately 5x on Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME, and scaling sleep-time compute can further improve accuracy by up to 18% on Stateful AIME. For AI practitioners, this implies that in stateful applications with available context (e.g., coding agents, document QA), implementing sleep-time compute can significantly cut test-time latency and cost while maintaining or improving accuracy, particularly when future queries are predictable. |
| Set You Straight: Auto-Steering Denoising Trajectories to Sidestep
  Unwanted Concepts (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12782) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.12782))| Adams Wai-Kin Kong, Yan Ren, Leyang Li, Shilin-LU | This paper introduces ANT, a finetuning framework for concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models that automatically guides denoising trajectories away from unwanted concepts. The primary objective is to overcome limitations of prior methods by enabling precise content modification during mid-to-late denoising stages without disrupting early-stage structural integrity or relying on heuristic anchor concepts. ANT utilizes a trajectory-aware loss function that reverses the classifier-free guidance condition direction only after a specific timestep (t') and employs an augmentation-enhanced weight saliency map to identify and finetune only the most relevant parameters for erasure. ANT achieves state-of-the-art results, reducing inappropriate image detections (e.g., NSFW content) on the I2P benchmark to 23, significantly lower than prior methods, while maintaining competitive FID and CLIP scores on MS-COCO. For AI practitioners, ANT provides a more effective and robust finetuning method to build safer generative models by removing unwanted concepts with less impact on overall generative quality and without needing manual anchor selection. |
| Perception Encoder: The best visual embeddings are not at the output of
  the network (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13181) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.13181))| Andrea Madotto, Jang Hyun Cho, Peize Sun, Po-Yao Huang, Daniel Bolya | Perception Encoder (PE) introduces a state-of-the-art vision encoder family achieving top performance across diverse tasks using only scaled contrastive vision-language pretraining, finding optimal embeddings within intermediate network layers. The main objective was to investigate if a single, scalable contrastive pretraining approach could generate strong, general visual embeddings suitable for classification, retrieval, language modeling, and spatial tasks without complex multi-objective training. The key methodology involved developing a robust image pretraining recipe, creating a video data engine using synthetically generated captions for video finetuning, and introducing language and spatial alignment tuning methods to extract and adapt features from specific intermediate layers. Primary results show PE models achieve state-of-the-art performance; for instance, PEcoreG obtains 86.6% average zero-shot image classification accuracy, outperforming previous models, and its intermediate features rival specialized models like AIMv2 (language) and DINOv2 (spatial) before alignment tuning. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that powerful, general-purpose visual embeddings can be learned via scaled contrastive learning alone, but optimal performance on diverse downstream tasks necessitates extracting and aligning features from intermediate layers rather than solely relying on the final network output. |

The research objective is to teach LLMs *when* and *how* to leverage external computational tools effectively for complex reasoning tasks where pure text-based approaches falter. The methodology uses supervised fine-tuning on synthetic code-augmented data for initialization, followed by PPO-based reinforcement learning where task outcome accuracy serves as the reward signal during policy rollouts involving real-time code execution. Primary results show ReTool significantly boosts performance and efficiency, achieving 67.0% accuracy on AIME 2024 (400k steps) versus a text-only RL baseline (40.0%, 1080k steps), and exhibits emergent capabilities like code self-correction. For AI practitioners, this work shows outcome-driven RL effectively teaches LLMs strategic tool use, yielding more capable and efficient reasoning models for computational tasks without complex reward engineering or explicit tool-use supervision. |

The main objective is to develop an effective end-to-end training scheme for both the VAE tokenizer and the diffusion model, overcoming the performance degradation observed when using standard diffusion loss for joint training. REPA-E utilizes representation alignment (REPA) loss to jointly optimize VAE and diffusion model parameters, applying standard diffusion loss only to the diffusion model via stop-gradients, and incorporates batch normalization and VAE regularization. The proposed method significantly accelerates training, achieving an FID of 4.07 on ImageNet 256x256 in 400k steps (over 17x faster than the REPA baseline) and attains a state-of-the-art FID of 1.26 with classifier-free guidance.

Primary results show Heimdall boosting verification accuracy from 62.5% to 94.5% on AIME2024 (97.5% with sampling), while Pessimistic Verification improved AIME2025 solving accuracy from 54.2% to 70.0% (16x compute budget with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B). The principal implication for AI practitioners is that utilizing dedicated RL-trained verifiers and selection algorithms like Pessimistic Verification can significantly enhance the reliability and performance of LLMs on complex problem-solving by explicitly verifying and selecting trustworthy solutions. |
| Seedream 3.0 Technical Report (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11346) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.11346))| Zhichao Lai, Xiaoxia Hou, Qiushan Guo, Lixue Gong, Yu Gao | Seedream 3.0 is presented as a high-performance Chinese-English bilingual text-to-image foundation model with significant improvements over its predecessor.

| How Instruction and Reasoning Data shape Post-Training: Data Quality
  through the Lens of Layer-wise Gradients (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10766) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.10766))| Ziyue Li, Yanhong Li, Ming Li, zhoutianyi | This paper analyzes how instruction and reasoning data quality impacts LLM post-training dynamics through the spectral properties of layer-wise gradients. The primary objective is to understand how low/high-quality instruction and reasoning data affect gradients and to unify different data quality evaluation metrics using gradient spectral characteristics. The study employs Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the layer-wise gradients (specifically Q, K, V, O projections) of various LLMs (Qwen2, Llama3, Gemma2 families) finetuned on datasets partitioned by quality metrics (IFD, InsTag, Difficulty, Reward) and compares instruction-following versus reasoning data. Results consistently show that higher-quality data, for both instruction and reasoning types, leads to lower nuclear norms and significantly higher effective ranks of the gradients; for instance, high-quality reasoning data (s1.1) yielded substantially higher effective ranks than high-quality instruction data across models (e.g., Table 2, Qwen2.5-7B K-projection high-quality reasoning rank 361.2 vs. instruction rank 153.3). The principal implication for AI practitioners is that the effective rank of layer-wise gradients offers a unified, robust metric to evaluate data quality, potentially guiding more effective data selection or synthesis strategies for stable LLM post-training, particularly for developing complex reasoning abilities. |

The objective is to provide a scalable, relative benchmark assessing LLM skills like strategic planning, theory of mind, and deception, often missed by static benchmarks, through competitive gameplay. Methodologically, TextArena employs diverse text-based games (single/two/multi-player) within a Gym-compatible interface, evaluating models online (model-vs-model/human) and tracking performance using TrueSkill ratings across 10 specific soft skills. Primary results include relative model rankings and granular skill profiles; preliminary data shows frontier models achieving TrueSkill scores in the 30-38 range in certain games, demonstrating capabilities relative to a collective human baseline, though performance varies significantly across tasks (Figure 2). For AI practitioners, TextArena offers a platform to benchmark complex agentic behaviors without human preference bias, diagnose specific model skill gaps (e.g., Persuasion vs. Spatial Thinking), and potentially generate diverse interaction data for RL-based agent training. |
| The Scalability of Simplicity: Empirical Analysis of Vision-Language
  Learning with a Single Transformer (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10462) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.10462))| Jun Hao Liew, Haochen Wang, Jiacong Wang, Weixian Lei, LXT | This paper introduces and empirically analyzes SAIL, a single-transformer architecture for joint vision-language processing, comparing its properties to modular designs. The research objective is to evaluate the scalability, cross-modal information flow patterns, and visual representation capabilities of this unified approach against modular Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that use separate vision encoders. SAIL employs a single transformer with mixed attention (bidirectional for image patches, causal for text) and multimodal rotary position embeddings (M-RoPE) to process raw pixels and text, evaluated via scaling experiments and performance on vision-language/vision benchmarks.

For AI practitioners, this indicates that unified single-transformer architectures are a viable, potentially more scalable alternative to complex modular designs, simplifying the model stack while achieving competitive performance, especially with large datasets. |
| Efficient Process Reward Model Training via Active Learning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10559) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.10559))| Tianyu Pang, Xin Mao, Zichen Liu, Keyu Duan, dreamerdeo | This paper proposes ACTPRM, an active learning framework to efficiently train Process Reward Models (PRMs) for large language models. The primary objective is to reduce the prohibitive annotation costs required for obtaining step-level supervision needed to train PRMs. ACTPRM employs an ensemble PRM to estimate both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty at each reasoning step, selectively forwarding only the most uncertain samples to a capable reasoning LLM for annotation, and then training the PRM exclusively on this subset. ACTPRM achieved state-of-the-art performance (75.0% average F1) on ProcessBench while requiring only 20% of the estimated annotation cost compared to the prior SOTA model, UniversalPRM. For AI practitioners, this methodology offers a significantly more cost-effective approach to training PRMs, enabling scalable development of LLMs with improved reasoning capabilities through fine-grained process supervision. |
| Efficient Generative Model Training via Embedded Representation Warmup (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10188) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.10188))| Tao Lin, Xufeng Li, Peng Sun, SempraETY | This paper introduces Embedded Representation Warmup (ERW) to accelerate diffusion model training by initializing early layers with pretrained representations. The primary objective is to improve training efficiency and representation quality by decoupling the representation learning phase from the generation phase in diffusion models. ERW employs a two-phase training strategy: first, a warmup phase aligns the initial layers (Latent-to-Representation circuit) with features from a pretrained model (e.g., Dinov2) using an alignment loss; second, standard diffusion training proceeds with a decaying alignment guidance term. Empirically, ERW demonstrates a 40x acceleration in training speed compared to the REPA baseline, achieving an FID of 6.0 on ImageNet-1k (SiT-XL/2, no CFG) within 100k iterations. For AI practitioners, ERW offers a plug-and-play method to significantly reduce computational costs and training time for large diffusion models by leveraging existing pretrained representation encoders, making state-of-the-art generative modeling more accessible. |

  Diffusion Priors (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11427) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.11427))| Bing Wang, Xinya Chen, Haoyuan Wang, Yanrui Bin, wbhu-tc | NormalCrafter introduces a novel method leveraging video diffusion priors to generate temporally consistent and detailed surface normals from open-world videos. The main objective is to address the challenge of maintaining both high spatial fidelity and temporal coherence in video-based normal estimation, which existing methods often fail to achieve simultaneously. Key methodology includes adapting a pre-trained video diffusion model (SVD), proposing Semantic Feature Regularization (SFR) to align internal features with semantic representations (from DINO), and utilizing a two-stage training protocol optimizing first in latent space for temporal context and then in pixel space for spatial accuracy. Primary results demonstrate superior performance on video benchmarks, achieving a 1.6° reduction in mean angular error on the Sintel dataset compared to the prior state-of-the-art, alongside improved temporal consistency. For AI practitioners, this research provides a framework for adapting large video generative models for downstream perception tasks, showcasing how diffusion priors combined with specific regularization and training strategies can yield high-fidelity, temporally stable outputs for video understanding applications like 3D reconstruction or editing. |
| A Minimalist Approach to LLM Reasoning: from Rejection Sampling to
  Reinforce (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11343) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.11343))| Lei Wang, Bo Pang, Yuhui Xu, Jiarui Yao, Wei Xiong | This paper analyzes simplified reinforcement learning algorithms for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks, demonstrating the strong performance of rejection sampling. The primary objective is to understand the sources of effectiveness in complex RL algorithms like GRPO and identify minimal yet performant alternatives. Key methodologies include empirical comparisons of RAFT (rejection sampling), vanilla Reinforce, GRPO, and PPO on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, alongside ablation studies isolating components like reward normalization and sample filtering, leading to a proposed variant, Reinforce-Rej. The primary result shows that RAFT achieves competitive performance (e.g., 49.9% average accuracy on Qwen2.5-Math-7B-base) compared to GRPO (53.9%) and PPO (51.8%), with GRPO's advantage largely attributed to filtering prompts with only incorrect responses, not reward normalization. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that simpler, computationally lighter methods like RAFT and the proposed Reinforce-Rej can be highly effective alternatives to complex RL algorithms for reward-based LLM fine-tuning, highlighting the crucial role of selective sample filtering over intricate algorithmic designs. |

  Verifiable Mathematical Dataset for Advancing Reasoning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11456) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.11456))| Xingyu Chen, Qiuzhi Liu, Jiahao Xu, Tian Liang, Zhiwei He | This paper introduces DeepMath-103K, a large-scale, challenging, decontaminated, and verifiable mathematical dataset designed for advancing AI reasoning via reinforcement learning. The primary objective was to create a dataset overcoming limitations of existing resources, namely insufficient difficulty, lack of verifiable answers for RL, benchmark contamination, and inadequate scale for highly challenging problems. The methodology involved a rigorous curation pipeline including source analysis, semantic decontamination against multiple benchmarks using LLM-judges, difficulty filtering focusing on levels 5-9, and answer verification through consistency checks across three distinct R1-generated solutions for each of the 103K problems. Models trained using RL-Zero on DeepMath-103K demonstrated significant performance improvements, with DeepMath-Zero-7B achieving 85.5% pass@1 accuracy on MATH500, substantially outperforming baseline and models trained on other RL datasets. For AI practitioners, DeepMath-103K provides a crucial, publicly available resource enabling the development and evaluation of more powerful reasoning systems, particularly through rule-based RL paradigms demanding verifiable answers and high problem complexity. |
| Diffusion Distillation With Direct Preference Optimization For Efficient
  3D LiDAR Scene Completion (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11447) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.11447))| Jiale Wu, Zejian Li, Ling Yang, Shengyuan Zhang, An Zhaol | This paper proposes Distillation-DPO, a novel framework integrating diffusion distillation with direct preference optimization for efficient and high-quality 3D LiDAR scene completion. The primary objective is to accelerate the slow sampling speed of diffusion models for LiDAR completion while mitigating performance degradation typically associated with distillation. Distillation-DPO generates paired completion samples using a student model with varied initial noise, constructs win/lose pairs based on non-differentiable LiDAR metrics (used as preference), and optimizes the student by minimizing the difference in score functions between teacher and student models on these pairs, facilitated by two teaching assistant models. Experiments demonstrate that Distillation-DPO achieves superior completion quality (e.g., 0.354 refined CD compared to the SOTA LiDiff's 0.375) while accelerating inference speed by over 5-fold (3.38s vs 17.87s). For AI practitioners, this method offers a way to significantly enhance the efficiency of diffusion models for 3D scene completion tasks, making them more viable for real-world applications by effectively using preference data to guide distillation without requiring differentiable reward functions. |
| PVUW 2025 Challenge Report: Advances in Pixel-level Understanding of
  Complex Videos in the Wild (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11326) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.11326))| Shuting He, Nikhila Ravi, Chang Liu, LXT, HenghuiDing | This report summarizes the 4th Pixel-level Video Understanding in the Wild (PVUW) Challenge, focusing on methods and results for complex video segmentation tasks. The primary objective was to benchmark and advance algorithms for complex video object segmentation (MOSE track) and motion/language-guided video segmentation (MeViS track) using new, challenging real-world datasets. Key methodologies employed by top teams included fine-tuning large foundation models like SAM2, utilizing multi-model ensembles, adaptive pseudo-labeling (e.g., PGMR), and integrating Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) like Sa2VA, evaluated via J&F scores on confidential test sets. The top team on the MOSE track achieved a J&F score of 87.26%, while the MeViS track winner reached 61.98%, showcasing the effectiveness of these advanced techniques. For AI practitioners, the principal implication is the demonstrated benefit of adapting large pre-trained vision and multimodal models (SAM2, LMMs) and using ensemble strategies to improve robustness and accuracy in complex, dynamic video understanding tasks. |
| ReZero: Enhancing LLM search ability by trying one-more-time (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11001) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.11001))| Thinh Le, alandao | ReZero introduces a reinforcement learning framework to enhance LLM search persistence within Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by rewarding query retries. The main objective is to improve LLM robustness in information retrieval by explicitly incentivizing the model to attempt subsequent searches if the initial one fails. The key methodology utilizes Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune an LLM, incorporating a specific `reward_retry` function that rewards additional search attempts conditional on generating a correct final answer. The primary result showed the ReZero model achieved 46.88% peak accuracy on the evaluation dataset, nearly doubling the 25.00% peak accuracy of a baseline model trained without the retry incentive. For AI practitioners, this implies that designing RL rewards to explicitly encourage persistence can significantly improve RAG system performance, especially for tasks where initial information retrieval attempts are likely insufficient. |
| AI-University: An LLM-based platform for instructional alignment to
  scientific classrooms (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08846) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.08846))| Rahul Gulati, Mostafa Faghih Shojaei, garikipati, Dinzhenzhenzhu, simocimolato | This paper introduces AI-University (AI-U), a framework using fine-tuned LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate instructor-aligned responses for scientific courses. The objective was to develop and evaluate a platform that adapts an LLM (Llama-3.2-11B) to a specific graduate-level Finite Element Method (FEM) course's content and teaching style using lecture transcripts, notes, and textbooks. Key methodology involved systematic question-answer pair generation for LoRA-based fine-tuning (creating LLaMA-TOMMI-1.0), followed by RAG synthesis for contextualized, referenced answers, evaluated via cosine similarity and LLM-as-a-judge. The fine-tuned LLaMA-TOMMI-1.0 model achieved higher cosine similarity to ground-truth answers than the base model on 86% of test cases and was preferred approximately four times more often by an LLM judge. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that this combined approach of systematic data generation for fine-tuning and RAG offers a robust method for developing domain-specific LLMs that exhibit strong alignment with specialized technical content and style, providing traceable and accurate AI assistance. |
| Adaptive Computation Pruning for the Forgetting Transformer (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06949) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.06949))| Aaron Courville, Johan Obando-Ceron, Zhixuan Lin, littleowen | This paper proposes Adaptive Computation Pruning (ACP) to accelerate the Forgetting Transformer (FoX) by dynamically skipping computations based on forget gate decay. The objective is to determine if dynamically pruning FoX attention computations based on decay strength can improve training throughput without performance loss. ACP employs a dynamic pruning threshold, calculated based on attention logit bounds and sequence length, to identify and skip negligible input-output dependency computations within a modified FlashAttention framework. Results demonstrate that ACP consistently reduces FLOPs in softmax attention by ~70% across different model sizes (125M-760M) and context lengths (4k-16k), resulting in 10%-35% faster training throughput without performance degradation on language modeling or downstream tasks. For AI practitioners, ACP provides a technique to significantly decrease computational costs and improve training efficiency for FoX models, particularly those with long contexts, while maintaining accuracy. |
| Multimodal Long Video Modeling Based on Temporal Dynamic Context (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10443) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.10443))| Xiangyu Yue, Yiyuan Zhang, Jiaming Han, Hoar012 | This paper introduces Temporal Dynamic Context (TDC), a method for multimodal long video understanding integrating static features and dynamic context compression. The research aims to address MLLM context length limitations and suboptimal multimodal integration (vision, audio) in long video processing. TDC segments videos by inter-frame similarity, encodes static keyframes fully, and uses a Q-Former to compress subsequent visual/audio tokens based on temporal differences relative to the static frame; a Long Video Chain-of-Thought (LVCoT) strategy handles extremely long videos without training. TDC demonstrates strong performance, outperforming the audio-visual VideoLLaMA2 model by 15.6% on the long-video MLVU benchmark. For AI practitioners, TDC provides an effective technique for encoding dense multimodal video data more efficiently, enabling MLLMs to process longer videos by compressing dynamic context while preserving key static details, reducing information loss compared to sparse sampling or purely visual compression methods. |
| Summarization of Multimodal Presentations with Vision-Language Models:
  Study of the Effect of Modalities and Structure (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10049) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.10049))| Frédéric Dufaux, Camille Guinaudeau, gigant | This paper analyzes how input modality and structure affect Vision-Language Model (VLM) performance for summarizing multimodal presentations. The primary objective is to evaluate the cost-performance tradeoffs of various input representations (raw video, extracted slides, transcript, structured/unstructured combinations) and suggest effective strategies. Using Qwen2-VL and other VLMs on a benchmark derived from the TIB dataset, the study measured performance with metrics like ROUGE and Importance-based Relevance (IbR). Results demonstrate that a structured representation using interleaved slides and transcript yields the best performance (e.g., Qwen2-VL 2B achieved ROUGE-1 of 27.1 and overall IbR of 33.4), significantly outperforming raw video or unstructured inputs. For AI practitioners, the key implication is that preprocessing presentations into structured, interleaved slide-transcript sequences offers the most effective input for VLM summarization, balancing computational cost and summary quality, especially for inputs exceeding approximately 6k tokens. |
| D^2iT: Dynamic Diffusion Transformer for Accurate Image Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09454) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.09454))| Zhendong Mao, Lei Zhang, Nan Chen, Mengqi Huang, Weinan Jia | This paper introduces D²iT, a Diffusion Transformer using dynamic compression based on regional information density to improve image generation accuracy. The main objective is to overcome the limitations of fixed spatial compression in standard Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) which disregard varying information densities across image regions. The methodology employs a two-stage framework: first, a Dynamic VAE (DVAE) uses a hierarchical encoder and information density estimation (Shannon entropy) to create multi-grained latent codes; second, the Dynamic Diffusion Transformer (D²iT) predicts corresponding multi-grained noise using novel Dynamic Grain and Content Transformers. Primary results demonstrate a significant quality improvement, achieving a 1.73 FID score on class-conditional ImageNet 256x256 generation, a 23.8% improvement over the baseline DiT's 2.27 FID, using only 57.1% of the training resources. For AI practitioners, this research implies that dynamically adapting compression and computational effort based on input complexity, rather than using fixed approaches, can yield substantial gains in both the performance and efficiency of generative models like DiTs. |
| Change State Space Models for Remote Sensing Change Detection (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11080) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.11080))| Erchan Aptoula, ElmanGhazaei | This paper introduces the Change State Space Model (CSSM), a computationally efficient Mamba-based architecture tailored for remote sensing change detection. The research objective is to develop a specialized state-space model that focuses exclusively on relevant bi-temporal changes, improving efficiency and accuracy over existing ConvNet, ViT, and general Mamba approaches for change detection. CSSM utilizes a lightweight CNN encoder-decoder framework incorporating a modified state space model block that employs an L1 distance mechanism on projected inputs to isolate and process only changed features between pre- and post-event images. Evaluated on benchmark datasets like LEVIR-CD+, CSSM achieved state-of-the-art performance, attaining an F1-score of 92.39 while requiring only 4.34M parameters and 5.10 GFLOPs, significantly less than comparable models. For AI practitioners, CSSM presents a highly resource-efficient architecture delivering state-of-the-art accuracy in change detection, making it suitable for large-scale analysis or deployment in computationally constrained environments. |
| LazyReview A Dataset for Uncovering Lazy Thinking in NLP Peer Reviews (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11042) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.11042))| Iryna Gurevych, Lizhen Qu, Anne Lauscher, Zhuang Li, sukannya | This paper introduces LAZYREVIEW, a dataset annotated with fine-grained categories to detect 'lazy thinking' heuristics in NLP peer reviews. The primary objective was to create this resource and evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically identify such instances. The methodology involved iteratively developing annotation guidelines over three rounds using ARR-22 reviews, annotating 500 expert and 1276 silver review segments, and evaluating LLMs using zero-shot, few-shot in-context learning, and instruction fine-tuning. Key results show that while LLMs struggle in zero-shot detection, instruction fine-tuning on LAZYREVIEW significantly boosts performance by 10-20 accuracy points (e.g., instruction-tuned Qwen achieved 59.4% string-matching accuracy for fine-grained classification). For AI practitioners, this provides a validated dataset and methodology for building automated tools to flag superficial review arguments, potentially improving review quality assessment systems and reviewer training. |

| Mavors: Multi-granularity Video Representation for Multimodal Large
  Language Model (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10068) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.10068))| kugwzk, zhenhuawu, UnnamedWatcher, CheeryLJH, DogNeverSleep | Mavors introduces a multi-granularity video representation framework for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) aimed at efficient long-context video understanding. The main objective is to balance computational efficiency with the retention of fine-grained spatio-temporal patterns, addressing information loss from methods like sparse sampling or token compression. Mavors uses an Intra-chunk Vision Encoder (IVE) for high-resolution spatial features within video segments and an Inter-chunk Feature Aggregator (IFA) with chunk-level rotary position embeddings (C-ROPE) for temporal coherence across segments. Results demonstrate Mavors-7B's strong performance, achieving a score of 39.4 on the DREAM-1K video captioning benchmark, significantly outperforming many comparable 7B models on tasks requiring fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning. For AI practitioners, Mavors offers an approach to enhance MLLM capabilities for long video analysis by preserving detailed spatio-temporal information more effectively than common sampling or compression strategies, crucial for applications needing nuanced video understanding. |
| AgentRewardBench: Evaluating Automatic Evaluations of Web Agent
  Trajectories (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08942) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.08942))| dongchans, arkilpatel, ncmeade, kazemnejad, xhluca | This paper introduces AGENTREWARDBENCH, a benchmark designed to evaluate the automatic evaluation of web agent trajectories by LLM judges. The main objective is to assess the effectiveness of LLMs in judging web agent success compared to expert human annotations, addressing limitations of rule-based and manual evaluations. The methodology involved collecting 1302 trajectories from 4 LLMs across 5 web environments, annotating each by experts for success, side effects, and repetition, and then using this dataset to evaluate 12 different LLM judges and existing rule-based methods. Primary results indicate that no single LLM judge performs best across all benchmarks, the best judges achieve less than 70% precision against expert labels, and official rule-based methods significantly underestimate agent success rates (55.9% recall). The principal implication for AI practitioners is that current automatic evaluation methods, including LLM judges, are not yet reliable enough for high-fidelity assessment or reward modeling, necessitating the development of more accurate automatic evaluation techniques for web agents. |

| Seaweed-7B: Cost-Effective Training of Video Generation Foundation Model (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08685) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.08685))| Zhijie Lin, Ceyuan Yang, Team Seawead, zhenheny, lingff | This paper details a cost-effective strategy for training Seaweed-7B, a 7-billion parameter video generation foundation model using moderate compute. The primary objective was to demonstrate that a medium-sized video generation model can achieve competitive performance compared to much larger models trained with significantly greater computational resources. Key methodologies involved training a novel 64x compression Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and a hybrid-stream Diffusion Transformer (DiT) from scratch on curated data using 665,000 H100 GPU hours, employing multi-stage training, SFT, DPO, and infrastructure optimizations like 3D parallelism and Multi-Level Activation Checkpointing (MLAC). Seaweed-7B achieved competitive performance, ranking second in image-to-video generation Elo ratings (1047 Elo, 58% win rate) against models like Sora and Wan 2.1, and its VAE obtained state-of-the-art reconstruction (e.g., 0.0391 LPIPS on UCF-101). Its distilled version requires only 12 NFEs for inference, 62 times faster than Wan 2.1 (100 NFEs).

Methodology involves a new dataset (VCR-Bench) with 859 videos and 1,034 QA pairs, featuring manually annotated, stepwise CoT rationales tagged for perception/reasoning, and a CoT score derived from recall/precision evaluation of these steps. Experiments reveal significant limitations in existing LVLMs, with the top-performing model achieving only a 62.8% CoT score and 56.7% accuracy, and most models exhibiting lower performance on perception steps compared to reasoning steps. For AI practitioners, VCR-Bench offers a standardized framework to identify specific weaknesses, particularly in temporal-spatial perception, providing actionable insights for improving LVLMs on complex video reasoning tasks. |
| MM-IFEngine: Towards Multimodal Instruction Following (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07957) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.07957))| yhcao, sweetFruit, KennyUTC, yuhangzang, ChrisDing1105 | MM-IFEngine introduces a pipeline for generating multimodal instruction-following data and the MM-IFEval benchmark for evaluation. The research objective is to address the scarcity of high-quality training data and the limitations of existing benchmarks for evaluating multimodal instruction following (IF) in MLLMs. Key methodology involves the MM-IFEngine pipeline using LLMs (GPT-4o) for image filtering, task generation, and integrating 32 constraint categories to create the MM-IFInstruct-23k (SFT) and MM-IFDPO-23k (DPO) datasets, alongside the MM-IFEval benchmark featuring hybrid evaluation. Primary results show fine-tuning Qwen2-VL-7B on MM-IFDPO-23k significantly improves IF performance, achieving gains of +10.2% on MM-IFEval and +7.6% on MIA-Bench, while maintaining comparable VQA capabilities. For AI practitioners, this work provides datasets (MM-IFInstruct-23k, MM-IFDPO-23k) and a benchmark (MM-IFEval) to train and rigorously evaluate MLLMs for enhanced instruction adherence, crucial for applications needing precise, constrained multimodal outputs. |

  In-Context Learning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07960) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.07960))| mingming8688, cosumosu25, JonsonYan, RuoyiDu, lzyhha | VisualCloze presents a universal image generation framework leveraging visual in-context learning (ICL) to perform diverse tasks using a unified infilling model approach. Its primary objective is to overcome limitations of language-based instructions and task sparsity by enabling a model to understand and generalize visual tasks from examples. The key methodology involves formulating generation tasks as infilling problems on a grid of concatenated visual prompts and targets, fine-tuning the FLUX.1-Fill-dev model with LoRA on the proposed dense Graph200K dataset. Results demonstrate strong performance on in-domain tasks, generalization to unseen tasks, and task unification, with ICL quantitatively improving results (e.g., reducing Depth-to-Image RMSE from 10.31 to 9.68 using two in-context examples). For AI practitioners, this work implies that visual ICL combined with pre-trained infilling models offers a promising, unified paradigm for building versatile image generation systems that can learn complex visual relationships and adapt to new tasks with fewer explicit instructions compared to purely language-guided or task-specific models. |
| DeepSeek-R1 Thoughtology: Let's <think> about LLM Reasoning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07128) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.07128))| parishadbehnam, miladink, vaibhavad, arkilpatel, spaidartaigar | This paper introduces "Thoughtology," a systematic analysis of the internal reasoning chains ("thoughts") produced by the Large Reasoning Model (LRM) DeepSeek-R1. The main objective is to characterize DeepSeek-R1's reasoning patterns, evaluate the impact of thought length and context on performance, and assess its safety and cognitive parallels. Key methodologies include developing a taxonomy for reasoning steps, quantitative evaluation on math (AIME-24, GSM8k, multiplication), long-context (Needle-in-a-Haystack, CHASE-QA/Code), safety (HarmBench), and cognitive/cultural benchmarks. Primary results indicate a consistent reasoning structure but reveal an optimal thought length 'sweet spot' beyond which performance declines; notably, DeepSeek-R1 also exhibits significant safety vulnerabilities, responding harmfully to 30.0% of direct HarmBench requests. For AI practitioners, this implies that controlling LRM thought length is crucial for performance and efficiency, yet DeepSeek-R1 lacks inherent mechanisms for this, and its reasoning capabilities introduce new safety risks requiring specific mitigation strategies beyond standard LLM alignment. |
| HoloPart: Generative 3D Part Amodal Segmentation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07943) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.07943))| Lp256, zouzx, KevinHuang, bennyguo, yhyang-myron | HoloPart introduces a generative approach for 3D part amodal segmentation, decomposing shapes into complete semantic parts, including occluded geometry. The primary objective is to address the limitations of standard 3D part segmentation by inferring and completing hidden part geometry while maintaining global shape consistency. The key methodology employs a two-stage approach: leveraging existing segmentation for initial surface patches, followed by HoloPart, a novel diffusion-based model using specialized local and context-aware attention mechanisms, to complete these patches into full parts. HoloPart significantly outperforms existing shape completion methods, achieving a mean instance IoU of 0.764 on the ABO benchmark compared to 0.565 for the next best baseline (Finetune-VAE). For AI practitioners, this work offers a tool to generate complete, semantically meaningful 3D parts from potentially incomplete data, enabling more robust downstream applications in 3D content creation, editing, and analysis. |
| C3PO: Critical-Layer, Core-Expert, Collaborative Pathway Optimization
  for Test-Time Expert Re-Mixing (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07964) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.07964))| Ziyue Li, zhoutianyi, Lzy01241010 | C3PO dynamically optimizes sub-optimal expert pathways in MoE LLMs at test-time to boost performance without retraining. The objective is to improve individual test sample predictions by re-mixing expert routing weights based on pathways from successful reference samples. C3PO employs collaborative optimization using neighbors in an embedding space to define a surrogate objective, focusing optimization on core experts within critical layers using methods like Neighborhood Gradient Descent (NGD). Results show C3PO improves base MoE accuracy by 7-15%; NGD on OLMoE-1B-7B achieved a 9.3% average accuracy increase (69.9% to 79.2%) across six benchmarks, enabling it to outperform 7-9B parameter dense models. AI practitioners can apply C3PO to enhance deployed MoE LLM performance on specific tasks or samples, potentially achieving higher accuracy with smaller models and reduced computational cost during inference. |
| MOSAIC: Modeling Social AI for Content Dissemination and Regulation in
  Multi-Agent Simulations (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07830) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.07830))| Marzyeh Ghassemi, saadia, elisakreiss, salmannyu, genglinliu | MOSAIC is an open-source multi-agent simulation framework using LLM agents to model social network content diffusion, user engagement, and moderation effects. The primary objective is to analyze LLM agent interactions, model misinformation propagation, and evaluate the efficacy of different content moderation strategies within a simulated social environment. The methodology employs LLM-driven agents (GPT-4o) assigned diverse personas who interact on a directed social graph, with their engagement patterns compared against human participants and tested under no-fact-checking, community-based, third-party, and hybrid moderation conditions. Key results indicate that simulated misinformation does not spread faster than factual content (unlike observed human behavior), and a hybrid fact-checking approach yielded the best balance of precision and recall (F1 score = 0.612) while enhancing factual content engagement. For AI practitioners, this suggests agent-based simulations can test moderation systems, but results must be critically evaluated as agent behavior, potentially influenced by safety training or simulation design, may deviate significantly from human patterns, impacting the direct applicability of findings to real-world platform governance. |
| Scaling Laws for Native Multimodal Models Scaling Laws for Native
  Multimodal Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07951) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.07951))| Joshua Susskind, Matthieu Cord, Victor Guilherme Turrisi da Costa, Enrico Fini, Mustafa Shukor | This paper investigates the scaling laws of native multimodal models (NMMs) trained from scratch, comparing early-fusion, late-fusion, and sparse architectures. The primary objective is to determine if commonly used late-fusion architectures hold an inherent advantage over early-fusion for NMMs and to characterize their scaling properties. The methodology involves training and evaluating 457 NMMs with varying architectures and training mixtures, deriving scaling laws by fitting power-law relationships between validation loss, compute (FLOPs), model parameters (N), and training tokens (D). Results indicate no inherent advantage for late-fusion; early-fusion performs comparably (loss L ∝ C^-0.049 for both) while being more parameter-efficient for compute-optimal models, and sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) significantly improve early-fusion performance. For AI practitioners, this suggests early-fusion NMMs, trained natively and potentially enhanced with MoEs, offer a viable and efficient alternative to late-fusion approaches that rely on separate pre-trained vision encoders, especially at lower parameter counts. |
| SoTA with Less: MCTS-Guided Sample Selection for Data-Efficient Visual
  Reasoning Self-Improvement (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07934) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.07934))| furongh-lab, kevinlin311tw, linjieli222, zyang39, russwang | This paper presents an MCTS-guided data selection method for efficient visual reasoning self-improvement in VLMs using less data and no knowledge distillation. The main objective is to enhance VLM reasoning capabilities through reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) using a minimal set of appropriately challenging training samples identified based on difficulty. The key methodology involves repurposing Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to quantify sample difficulty by measuring the iterations required for the base VLM (Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct) to solve each problem, filtering 70k samples down to 11k. The resulting model, ThinkLite-VL-7B, trained on only 11k samples, achieves 75.1 accuracy on MathVista, surpassing larger models and improving the average benchmark performance of the base VLM by 7% (from 59.69 to 63.89). For AI practitioners, this demonstrates that strategically selecting challenging training data using MCTS for RFT can yield state-of-the-art reasoning performance in VLMs with significantly reduced data requirements, optimizing resource utilization. |
| Towards Visual Text Grounding of Multimodal Large Language Model (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04974) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.04974))| Franck-Dernoncourt, YfZ, JoshuaGu, zhangry868, MingLiiii | This paper introduces TRIG, a novel task, benchmark (TRIG-Bench), and dataset to evaluate and improve the visual text grounding capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on text-rich document images. The main research objective is to address the poor performance of existing MLLMs in localizing specific text regions within documents that support their generated answers for question-answering tasks. Methodology involved creating the TRIG-Bench benchmark (800 manually verified QA pairs) and a 90k synthetic instruction dataset using an OCR-LLM-human interaction pipeline, and proposing instruction-tuning and embedding-based grounding methods. Evaluation revealed significant limitations in current models on TRIG-Bench (e.g., GPT-4o achieved only 5.28% average pixel-level IoU in the OCR-free setting), while the proposed instruction-tuning method improved performance considerably to 29.98% average IoU after fine-tuning. For AI practitioners, this research provides a standardized benchmark and effective fine-tuning methods to assess and enhance MLLMs' ability to ground answers in documents, crucial for building more trustworthy and verifiable document understanding systems. |
| MonoPlace3D: Learning 3D-Aware Object Placement for 3D Monocular
  Detection (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06801) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.06801))| R. Venkatesh Babu, Jogendra Kundu, Sarthak Vora, Srinjay Sarkar, RishubhPar | MonoPlace3D learns realistic, scene-aware 3D object placement to generate effective data augmentations for improving monocular 3D object detection. The main objective is to automatically determine plausible 3D bounding box parameters (position, dimensions, orientation) for inserting synthetic objects into real scenes, addressing a key limitation of prior augmentation methods focused mainly on appearance. The methodology involves training a Scene-Aware Placement Network (SA-PlaceNet) on inpainted scenes to predict a distribution over plausible 3D boxes, then sampling from this distribution and rendering realistic objects using synthetic assets refined by ControlNet. MonoPlace3D significantly improves detection accuracy across multiple detectors and datasets; for example, on KITTI (easy, AP40@IOU=0.7) with MonoDLE, it boosted AP from 17.45% to 22.49% and achieved performance comparable to using the full dataset with only 50% of the data. For AI practitioners, this work demonstrates that focusing on learning physically plausible object placement is crucial for creating highly effective 3D data augmentations, leading to substantial gains in detector performance and data efficiency. |
| Compass Control: Multi Object Orientation Control for Text-to-Image
  Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06752) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.06752))| R. Venkatesh Babu, Vaibhav Agrawal, sachi1, RishubhPar | Compass Control introduces a method for precise, explicit 3D orientation control of individual objects within text-to-image diffusion models. The primary objective is to enable users to specify the desired 3D orientation for multiple objects in a scene alongside a text prompt, overcoming the limitations and imprecision of text-only control. Key methodology involves predicting orientation-aware 'compass tokens' via a lightweight encoder, prepending them to object tokens in the text prompt, and using 'Coupled Attention Localization (CALL)' to constrain the cross-attention maps of compass and object tokens to corresponding 2D bounding box regions. The approach achieves superior orientation control, yielding a significantly lower angular error (0.198 radians for single objects, 0.215 for multiple) compared to baselines like LooseControl (0.385 and 0.372 respectively), and generalizes effectively to unseen objects and scenes with more than two objects. For AI practitioners, this provides a user-friendly interface for granular 3D orientation control in generative models using only orientation angles and coarse 2D boxes, enhancing predictability and streamlining creative workflows without requiring dense 3D data. |

The primary objective is to develop a simpler, more scalable TAP model by removing complex tracking-specific inductive biases and heuristics found in prior work. It employs a causal architecture combining ViT and SSM layers (TRecViT) to jointly process image patch tokens and masked point coordinate tokens, predicting trajectories via token imputation using a classification-based coordinate head. The method achieves state-of-the-art online tracking performance, with BootsTAPNext-B reaching 78.5 Average Jaccard (AJ) on DAVIS First at 256x256 resolution, outperforming previous frame-latency methods while operating purely online. For AI practitioners, TAPNext demonstrates that general-purpose sequence models with minimal task-specific components can achieve SOTA performance in complex correspondence tasks like point tracking, offering a potentially more scalable and easily adaptable approach for applications requiring online video understanding. |

Key results show DDT-XL/2 achieves a state-of-the-art 1.31 FID on ImageNet 256x256 in 256 epochs, indicating approximately 4x faster convergence than prior diffusion transformers like REPA. For AI practitioners, DDT offers a significantly more efficient architecture for training high-fidelity diffusion models and introduces a statistical dynamic programming approach to accelerate inference by sharing encoder computations between steps with minimal performance loss. |

The system traces LM responses (average 450 tokens) to the training data in 4.5 seconds on average. OLMOTRACE enables AI practitioners to explore the relationship between LM outputs and training data for fact-checking, creativity analysis, and understanding math capabilities.  |

The objective is to assess GPT-4o's image generation capabilities by qualitatively benchmarking it against models like Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental and domain-SOTA methods across >20 tasks (text-to-image, image-to-image, image-to-3D, image-to-X). Methodology relies on structured visual evaluation and error analysis (detailed qualitatively in Table 1) due to the lack of API access and unpublished architecture. Primary results show GPT-4o excels in exceptional text rendering, compositional prompt following, spatial reasoning, and image transformation, often surpassing benchmarks qualitatively, but exhibits limitations in inconsistent generation, hallucination, and data bias (e.g., non-Latin scripts); the study explicitly notes the qualitative nature and lack of quantitative metrics. For AI practitioners, GPT-4o's notably strong text rendering capability demonstrates potential for unified models requiring precise visual-textual alignment, although current reliability issues (inconsistency, bias) warrant caution for direct deployment. |
| Hogwild! Inference: Parallel LLM Generation via Concurrent Attention (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06261) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.06261))| Vage Egiazarian, George Yakushev, Alina Shutova, Roman Garipov, Gleb Rodionov | **Hogwild! Inference: Parallel LLM Generation via Concurrent Attention**  This paper proposes Hogwild! Inference, a method enabling multiple instances of the same LLM to generate text in parallel while sharing and concurrently updating a common Key-Value attention cache. The main objective is to explore if LLMs can develop dynamic collaboration strategies for problem-solving without pre-defined frameworks, leveraging immediate access to each other's partial progress. The key methodology involves running parallel LLM "workers" with a shared KV cache, utilizing Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to efficiently manage positional information across workers and testing three cache layouts: contiguous, interleaved, and combined. Preliminary results on LIMO mathematical reasoning tasks show that the Hogwild! Combined layout allows multiple workers (e.g., 2 workers) to achieve higher accuracy faster than single-threaded baselines or independent parallel workers, reaching approximately 89% accuracy with an 8192 max forward pass budget, surpassing other methods at equivalent budgets. For AI practitioners, the principal implication is that existing reasoning-capable LLMs can potentially leverage shared KV caches for parallel, collaborative inference out-of-the-box to improve efficiency, without requiring model fine-tuning or explicit coordination protocols. |

The primary objective is to reliably evaluate genuine LLM reasoning capabilities, distinguishing it from memorization resulting from training data contamination of static benchmarks. KUMO employs a neural-symbolic pipeline utilizing LLMs for domain generation and SAT-based engines for task instantiation, creating partially observable, multi-turn reasoning games across numerous domains with adjustable difficulty, evaluated via success rate and relative action count. Key results from evaluating 23 LLMs on 5,000 tasks across 100 domains show reasoning-scaled models achieve university-level performance on complex tasks, and KUMO performance correlates strongly (Pearson correlation > 0.9 on hard setting vs MMLU-Pro/LiveBench-Reason) with recent real-world benchmarks, while experiments demonstrate resistance to overfitting. For AI practitioners, KUMO provides a scalable, dynamic, and contamination-resistant benchmark methodology for assessing the true reasoning progress of LLMs, facilitating more reliable model evaluation and development efforts compared to potentially saturated static datasets. |

  with Controllable Puzzle Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00043) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.00043))| William W. Cohen, Bill Yuchen Lin, Langlin Huang, Chengsong Huang, Jixuan Leng | This paper introduces CrossWordBench, a benchmark using controllable crossword puzzles to evaluate the multimodal reasoning of LLMs and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). The main objective is to assess model capabilities in handling tasks requiring simultaneous adherence to semantic constraints from text clues and structural constraints from visual grids. Methodologically, it utilizes a controllable puzzle generation framework creating text and image formats from diverse sources and evaluates over 20 models using zero-shot Chain-of-Thought and interactive modes.

The flow-aligned guidance approach offers AI practitioners a method for improving image fidelity and detail in high-resolution T2I tasks without requiring model retraining. The paper does not provide information about the compute resources required or its use with large language models.  |
| Leanabell-Prover: Posttraining Scaling in Formal Reasoning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06122) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.06122))| Yang Yue, Yahui Liu, Xingguang Ji, Qi Wang, Jingyuan Zhang | Leanabell-Prover improves automated theorem proving (ATP) through posttraining scaling of large language models using Lean 4 code.

| One-Minute Video Generation with Test-Time Training (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05298) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.05298))| guestrin, zhaoyue-zephyrus, GashonHussein, koceja, karansdalal | This paper introduces Test-Time Training (TTT) layers integrated into a Diffusion Transformer to generate coherent one-minute videos from text storyboards. The main objective is to address the inefficiency of self-attention and the limited expressiveness of standard RNN hidden states for generating long videos with complex narratives. The key methodology involves adding TTT layers, whose hidden states are neural networks (specifically two-layer MLPs) updated via test-time gradient descent on a self-supervised reconstruction task, to a pre-trained CogVideo-X 5B model and fine-tuning on a curated Tom and Jerry dataset. The primary result shows that TTT layers significantly improve video coherence and storytelling for one-minute videos compared to baselines like Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet, leading by 34 Elo points in human evaluations, although some artifacts persist and efficiency needs improvement. For AI practitioners, this demonstrates TTT layers as a viable approach to enhance temporal consistency in long video generation, offering a mechanism to handle extended contexts beyond typical attention or RNN limitations, but requiring consideration of current efficiency trade-offs. |
| SmolVLM: Redefining small and efficient multimodal models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05299) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.05299))| eliebak, mervenoyan, mfarre, orrzohar, andito | SmolVLM introduces a family of compact, efficient Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for resource-constrained inference on edge devices. The primary objective was to engineer small VLMs by systematically exploring architectural configurations, tokenization strategies, and data curation optimized for low computational overhead and minimal memory footprints. Key methodologies included investigating encoder-LM parameter balance, optimizing context length and pixel shuffling for token reduction, evaluating learned versus string positional tokens, using image splitting, and carefully curating training data mixes (including CoT and video duration). Results show the smallest model (SmolVLM-256M) achieves a 44.0% average score across benchmarks using less than 1GB GPU RAM, outperforming significantly larger models, while the 2.2B variant rivals state-of-the-art models requiring double the GPU memory. For AI practitioners, the principal implication is that strategic architectural optimizations, aggressive tokenization, and curated data enable high-performance multimodal capabilities at much smaller scales, facilitating practical deployment on edge devices. |
| T1: Tool-integrated Self-verification for Test-time Compute Scaling in
  Small Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04718) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.04718))| Jaewoong Cho, Jongwon Jeong, Nardien | This paper introduces Tool-integrated Self-verification (T1) to enhance small language model (sLM) self-verification during test-time compute scaling by using external tools. The main research objective is to investigate if sLMs can reliably perform self-verification for test-time scaling, particularly for memorization-heavy tasks, and to improve this capability without resorting to larger models. The key methodology involves T1, a two-stage process combining a tool-based verifier (ToolV) leveraging external tools (e.g., code interpreter) for filtering, and a reward model (RM)-based verifier for scoring, with both components enhanced via knowledge distillation from larger teacher models. Primary results demonstrate that T1 significantly boosts sLM performance; specifically, a Llama-3.2 1B model using T1 under test-time scaling outperformed a significantly larger Llama-3.1 8B model on the MATH benchmark. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that integrating external tools via methods like T1 can substantially improve the reasoning and verification capabilities of computationally cheaper sLMs, enabling them to tackle complex tasks more effectively and potentially match larger model performance in specific domains. |
| URECA: Unique Region Caption Anything (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05305) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.05305))| Heeji Yoon, seungryong, crepejung00, junwann, SammyLim | URECA introduces a large-scale dataset and novel model for generating unique captions for image regions at multiple granularities. The primary objective is to address the limitation of existing methods that struggle to produce distinctive descriptions for regions across varying levels of detail, especially distinguishing visually similar regions. The methodology involves a four-stage automated data curation pipeline utilizing mask trees and MLLMs to generate unique captions, and a captioning model featuring a dynamic mask encoder that preserves spatial properties for multi-granularity inputs. The proposed URECA model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the new dataset, attaining a BERTScore of 75.11, and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on benchmarks like Visual Genome with a METEOR score of 18.4. For AI practitioners, this work provides a robust dataset and model architecture enabling the generation of precise, context-aware natural language descriptions for arbitrarily selected image regions, enhancing detailed visual understanding applications. |
| Quantization Hurts Reasoning? An Empirical Study on Quantized Reasoning
  Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04823) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.04823))| Yuxuan Sun, Tiezheng, baihaoli, manyi2024, ruikangliu | This paper empirically investigates the impact of quantization on the reasoning abilities of large language models. The primary objective is to systematically evaluate how weight-only, KV cache, and weight-activation quantization affect reasoning performance across various model families, sizes, and tasks. The study quantizes DeepSeek-R1-Distilled Qwen/LLaMA families (1.5B-70B) and QwQ-32B using state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g., AWQ, QuaRot, FlatQuant) and evaluates them on mathematical, scientific, and programming reasoning benchmarks. Key findings reveal that W8A8 weight-activation or W4A16 weight-only/KV cache quantization can achieve near-lossless performance (≤1% accuracy drop), whereas lower bit-widths introduce significant risks, influenced by model size, origin (distilled vs. RL), and task difficulty. For AI practitioners, this implies that while 8-bit or selective 4-bit quantization can preserve reasoning with minimal loss, aggressive low-bit quantization requires careful consideration of the specific model and task, with FlatQuant and AWQ/QuaRot being preferred algorithms for weight-activation and weight-only/KV cache respectively. |
| Concept Lancet: Image Editing with Compositional Representation
  Transplant (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02828) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.02828))| Hancheng Min, Tianjiao Ding, CCB, ryanckh, peterljq | Concept Lancet (CoLan) introduces a zero-shot, plug-and-play framework for diffusion-based image editing using sparse concept decomposition and transplant in latent space. The research aims to solve the challenge of accurately determining the required edit strength for concept manipulation in images, avoiding over/under-editing without costly trial-and-error. CoLan employs a large curated concept dictionary (CoLan-150K), VLM-based parsing for task-specific concepts, and sparse coding to decompose the source latent vector (text embedding or diffusion score), allowing targeted replacement (transplant) of concept vectors. Equipping editing backbones like P2P-Zero with CoLan significantly improved consistency preservation, reducing LPIPS by nearly 50% (from 273.8/142.4 to 120.3/68.43 x10^-3 on whole image/background) while enhancing edit effectiveness on the PIE-Bench dataset. AI practitioners can integrate CoLan into diffusion editing pipelines to achieve more precise and consistent edits automatically by estimating and applying appropriate concept-specific magnitudes, eliminating the need for manual edit strength tuning per image. |
| LiveVQA: Live Visual Knowledge Seeking (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05288) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.05288))| Yao Wan, Mingyang Fu, shuaishuaicdp, Tim666, Ayiirep | This paper introduces LIVEVQA, a benchmark dataset automatically collected from recent news to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on live visual knowledge seeking. The research objective is to assess the capability of current MLLMs to answer questions demanding understanding of up-to-date visual knowledge synthesized from internet news content. Methodology involved creating the LIVEVQA dataset (3,602 single- and multi-hop visual questions from 1,233 news instances across 14 categories) and evaluating 15 MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemma-3, Qwen-2.5-VL) with and without search tool integration. Primary results demonstrate that while stronger models perform better overall, significant performance gaps persist, particularly for complex multi-hop questions requiring recent visual knowledge; Gemini-2.0-Flash achieved the highest accuracy at 24.93% without search integration. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that current MLLMs, even sophisticated ones, struggle significantly with visual questions requiring timely, real-world knowledge and complex reasoning, highlighting a critical need for improved visual grounding and knowledge integration mechanisms. |
| Are You Getting What You Pay For? Auditing Model Substitution in LLM
  APIs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04715) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.04715))| Tianneng Shi, Will Cai, dawnsong, Xuandong | This paper evaluates methods for detecting undisclosed model substitution in black-box Large Language Model (LLM) APIs. The objective is to formalize the API auditing problem and assess the robustness of software-based verification techniques (text classification, MMD, benchmarks, log probability analysis) and hardware solutions (TEEs) against adversarial attacks like quantization and randomized substitution. Methodology involves empirical evaluation of these techniques using various LLMs (Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Qwen2) under different attack scenarios, including comparing outputs, benchmark scores, and log probabilities. Primary results indicate that text-output-based methods are ineffective against subtle changes like quantization (e.g., text classifiers achieve only ~50% accuracy distinguishing original vs. quantized models) and randomized substitution (MMD test power drops significantly), while log probability analysis is more sensitive but relies on often unavailable API features; TEEs show promise with low performance overhead (<3% throughput impact under load). The principal implication for AI practitioners is that relying solely on current software-based verification for API model identity is unreliable, highlighting the need for enhanced provider transparency or hardware-attested environments like TEEs to ensure model integrity in critical applications and benchmarking. |
| Gaussian Mixture Flow Matching Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05304) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.05304))| saibi, wetzste1, luanfujun, zexiangxu, Lakonik | GMFlow introduces a novel flow matching model predicting Gaussian mixture (GM) parameters instead of just the mean velocity to enhance generative modeling. The primary objective is to overcome the limitations of discretization errors in few-step sampling and color over-saturation issues associated with classifier-free guidance (CFG) in existing diffusion and flow matching models. Key methodology involves parameterizing the flow velocity as a GM, training with a KL divergence loss, deriving novel GM-SDE/ODE solvers that leverage analytic distributions, and introducing a probabilistic guidance mechanism for CFG reweighting rather than extrapolation. GMFlow demonstrates superior performance, achieving a Precision of 0.942 with only 6 sampling steps and a state-of-the-art Precision of 0.950 with 32 steps on ImageNet 256x256, significantly outperforming baselines, especially in few-step scenarios. For AI practitioners, this provides a framework for developing generative models capable of faster, higher-fidelity sampling with reduced CFG-induced saturation artifacts. |

The primary objective was to improve TA-LLM handling of incomplete or out-of-scope user queries by adapting DPO without requiring new expert demonstrations. Key methodology involves modeling interactions as a Markov Decision Process, automatically constructing paired chosen/rejected dialogue trajectory datasets based on defined query types, and applying a specialized DiaTool-DPO objective loss with turn-length normalization and reward gap margins. Experiments showed DiaTool-DPO significantly improved LLaMA3-8B-Instruct's performance over SFT-only baselines, achieving 91.7% slot-filling accuracy (a 44% improvement) and 91.3% relevance accuracy (a 9.6% improvement), nearing GPT-4o performance. For AI practitioners, this method offers a way to train more robust TA-LLMs capable of managing ambiguous requests and unavailable tools using automatically generated preference data, reducing problematic tool calls without manual labeling. |

The primary objective is to overcome limitations inherent in value-based RL for long-CoT, specifically value model bias, handling heterogeneous sequence lengths, and sparse reward signals, aiming to surpass existing value-free methods. VAPO employs a modified Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) approach incorporating seven key techniques, including Value-Pretraining, Decoupled and Length-Adaptive Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE), Token-Level Loss, Clip-Higher clipping, Positive Example LM Loss, and Group-Sampling. Benchmarked on AIME 2024 using a Qwen-32B model, VAPO achieved a state-of-the-art score of 60.4 within 5,000 training steps, significantly outperforming the prior SOTA value-free method DAPO by over 10 points while demonstrating greater training stability and efficiency. For AI practitioners, VAPO presents a robust and efficient value-based RL alternative for training high-performance reasoning models, offering improved stability and potentially higher accuracy ceilings compared to value-free methods on complex, long-CoT tasks. |
| Mamba as a Bridge: Where Vision Foundation Models Meet Vision Language
  Models for Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03193) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.03193))| robbytan, XinNUS | This paper introduces MFuser, a Mamba-based framework to efficiently fuse Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS). The primary objective is to combine the complementary strengths of VFMs (fine-grained features) and VLMs (robust text alignment) while overcoming the challenges of long-sequence modeling and computational cost associated with integrating large models. The key methodology involves two components: MVFuser, a Mamba-based co-adapter for joint parameter-efficient fine-tuning of VFM and VLM visual features, and MTEnhancer, a hybrid attention-Mamba module to refine VLM text embeddings using visual priors. MFuser significantly outperforms existing DGSS methods, achieving a state-of-the-art 68.20 mIoU on the synthetic-to-real benchmark (G→{C, B, M} average) using DINOv2 and EVA02-CLIP. For AI practitioners, this work presents a computationally efficient Mamba-based adapter approach (MVFuser) to synergistically combine diverse foundation models, enhancing generalization for semantic segmentation tasks without requiring full fine-tuning of the base models. |

The main objective was to shift evaluation from lab-like setups towards real-world applicability, notably by requiring methods to onboard unseen objects from reference videos without CAD models in model-free tracks. Key methodology involved evaluating methods across seven tracks defined by task (6D localization, 6D detection, 2D detection), onboarding setup (model-based, model-free), and dataset group (BOP-Classic-Core, BOP-H3) using established metrics like Average Recall (AR) and Average Precision (AP). Primary results showed significant progress: the best model-based 6D localization method for unseen objects (FreeZeV2.1) achieved 82.1 AR on BOP-Classic-Core, 22% higher than the 2023 best, though 2D detection for unseen objects still lags significantly (-53% behind seen objects), indicating it's the main pipeline bottleneck. For AI practitioners, this highlights substantial improvements in unseen object pose estimation accuracy but underscores the critical need to advance 2D detection capabilities for robust real-world system deployment. |

| Agentic Knowledgeable Self-awareness (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03553) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.03553))| Xiangyuan Ru, Xiaobin Wang, Baochang Ren, Zhisong Qiu, Shuofei Qiao | This paper introduces agentic knowledgeable self-awareness, enabling LLM agents to autonomously regulate knowledge utilization based on situational difficulty. The research objective is to overcome the limitations of traditional "flood irrigation" methods by allowing agents to decide when to use internal capabilities, reflect, or seek external knowledge. The proposed method, KnowSelf, employs a heuristic situation judgment criterion on self-explored trajectories and a two-stage (SFT + RPO) training process using special tokens to signify different cognitive states (fast, slow, knowledgeable thinking). Experiments demonstrate KnowSelf achieves superior performance with minimal knowledge; for instance, on ALFWorld using Llama-8B, it attained an 84.33% average reward while using external knowledge for only 15.01% of actions, outperforming baselines. For AI practitioners, this implies a method to train more efficient agents that dynamically manage computational resources (like reflection or knowledge retrieval) based on assessed task complexity, potentially reducing inference costs and improving robustness. |

The primary objective was to create a standardized evaluation framework addressing the lack of unified standards and benchmarks for mixed-modality generation capabilities in U-MLLMs. The methodology involved curating tasks from 12 datasets, standardizing formats (e.g., multiple-choice QA, normalized scores), and designing five new 'unify' tasks (e.g., Visual CoT, Image Editing & Explaining) requiring synergistic understanding and generation. Evaluations of 12 U-MLLMs revealed significant room for improvement, especially in instruction following and unified tasks, with the top model Gemini2.0-flash-exp achieving an MME-U score of 45.57, while many models struggled significantly on complex unified tasks. For AI practitioners, this highlights current U-MLLM limitations in reliably performing complex, integrated multimodal reasoning and generation, underscoring the need for improved model architectures and training strategies for robust real-world deployment. |

Key results show significant improvements over existing methods, achieving up to 25.62 dB PSNR in reconstruction quality, a 12.65% increase compared to prior SOTA on CustomHumans. For AI practitioners, this work demonstrates a technique combining explicit 3D representation (3DGS) with generative video restoration and attention modulation to create higher-quality, consistent digital humans from minimal input, applicable to virtual avatar creation and animation. |
| TransMamba: Flexibly Switching between Transformer and Mamba (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24067) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.24067))| Shuaipeng Li, Xingwu Sun, Ruobing Xie, andyyang, Yixinglee | This paper proposes TransMamba, a framework unifying Transformer and Mamba using shared parameters to switch dynamically between attention and state space model (SSM) mechanisms. The objective is to leverage the strengths of both Transformer (short context efficiency) and Mamba (long context efficiency) within a single flexible architecture, overcoming static hybrid model limitations. TransMamba utilizes shared QKV/CBx parameters and introduces a "Memory Converter" for lossless state transfer at designated sequence positions ("TransPoints"), with a scheduling strategy determining the switch points across layers. Experiments show TransMamba achieves superior efficiency (e.g., 0.75 relative training time vs. 1.00 for Transformer at 1.5B parameters) and performance on benchmarks like LongBench-v2 (38.76 overall score vs. 31.61 for Transformer-1.5B) compared to baseline Transformer, Mamba2, and static Hybrid models. For AI practitioners, TransMamba presents a scalable architecture potentially offering improved training/inference efficiency and performance, especially for applications involving variable sequence lengths, by dynamically selecting the optimal computation mechanism (Attention or SSM) per token segment and layer. |

The main objective is to develop a single model capable of controllably relighting humans in images/videos (using Spherical Harmonics or background scenes), ensuring harmonization and temporal coherence across arbitrary body parts and scenes without large-scale supervised video data. The methodology utilizes a pre-trained latent diffusion model in a coarse-to-fine framework conditioned via ControlNet on coarse shading and background inputs, combined with an unsupervisedly trained temporal module (using cycle consistency) integrated via spatio-temporal feature blending and followed by guided refinement. Results show superior performance over baselines, achieving, for example, the best temporal consistency score (tLPIPS of 0.026, lower is better) on a challenging synthetic video benchmark (Scenario 3), compared to the next best (0.028).

As a survey, the paper synthesizes existing research across these four areas rather than presenting novel quantitative findings, identifying key research gaps, challenges, and opportunities. For AI practitioners, this work provides a unified framework for designing, evaluating, and ensuring the safety of complex Foundation Agents, emphasizing the need to harmonize modular design, adaptive capabilities, and collaborative potential with robust safety and ethical considerations. |
| Envisioning Beyond the Pixels: Benchmarking Reasoning-Informed Visual
  Editing (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02826) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.02826))| Rethinker, GTZhai, KexianTang, zpy777, PhoenixZ | This paper introduces RISEBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate Reasoning-Informed Visual Editing (RISE) capabilities in Large Multi-modality Models (LMMs). The main objective is to systematically assess LMM performance on visual editing tasks requiring Temporal, Causal, Spatial, and Logical reasoning beyond simple pixel manipulation. The methodology involves curating image-instruction test cases for each reasoning type and evaluating model outputs (from models like GPT-4o-Native, Gemini-2.0-Flash, EMU2) using both human judges and an LMM-as-a-judge (GPT-4o) framework across dimensions of Instruction Reasoning, Appearance Consistency, and Visual Plausibility. Primary results indicate that while GPT-4o-Native significantly outperforms other models with a 35.9% overall accuracy, even this state-of-the-art model struggles notably with logical reasoning tasks (37.5% accuracy), and open-source models achieve near-zero accuracy on RISEBench. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that current SOTA LMMs exhibit significant deficiencies in integrating complex, especially logical, reasoning within visual editing, highlighting a critical area requiring further research and development before such capabilities can be reliably deployed. |

  Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02782) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.02782))| shawnxyh, BestWishYsh, SereinH, liweijia, Yejy53 | This paper introduces GPT-ImgEval, a benchmark for quantitatively and qualitatively evaluating OpenAI's GPT-4o model in image generation and editing tasks. The main objective was to assess GPT-4o's performance across generation quality, editing proficiency, and world knowledge-informed synthesis, while also investigating its potential underlying architecture. Methodology involved evaluating GPT-4o using the GenEval, Reason-Edit, and WISE datasets via custom automation scripts, and employing a classification model trained to distinguish between diffusion and auto-regressive outputs to infer GPT-4o's generation mechanism. Primary results indicate GPT-4o significantly surpasses prior models, achieving an overall score of 0.84 on GenEval, and empirical analysis suggests it likely uses a hybrid auto-regressive architecture combined with a diffusion-based head, contrary to VAR-like structures. For AI practitioners, this work provides a standardized evaluation framework, highlights GPT-4o's advanced capabilities and specific limitations (e.g., editing inconsistencies, non-English text issues), and notes its outputs are detectable by current forensic models, impacting considerations for deployment and safety. |

  From-Scratch Framework and Comprehensive Evaluation Scheme (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02587) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.02587))| Pengfei, IanZhong, Ryan1122, steffichern, ManTle | This paper introduces MAYE, a transparent, from-scratch Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), alongside a comprehensive evaluation scheme. The main objective is to improve reproducibility and standardized assessment in RL for VLMs, addressing limitations of complex, opaque existing frameworks. Methodologically, it presents a minimal four-step RL pipeline (using Reinforce++ with KL penalty) built with standard libraries and introduces an evaluation scheme tracking dynamics like accuracy curves, response length, and reflection ratios. Key results show RL consistently surpasses Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) generalization, achieving a 1.35x average accuracy increase (peaking at 1.76x) on the mm\_math5k validation set compared to the baseline, even when SFT uses high-quality data; findings also indicate response length sensitivity to random seeds and correlation between reflection and output length. For AI practitioners, this provides a reproducible baseline framework (MAYE) for VLM RL experimentation and demonstrates RL's potential for superior generalization over SFT on visual reasoning tasks, suggesting its utility even with access to good supervised data. |

Key methodologies include a comprehensive data pipeline for constructing prompt-reference-video triplets, a novel joint image-text embedding model integrated into a diffusion transformer architecture with distinct spatial and semantic feature branches, and inference acceleration strategies. Evaluated on the proposed A2-Bench benchmark, SkyReels-A2 achieves comparable quantitative results to closed-source models, notably scoring 0.809 in object consistency, slightly outperforming competitors like Vidu (0.796) and Keling (0.790). For AI practitioners, SkyReels-A2 provides a publicly available model and benchmark for controllable multi-element video generation, facilitating development in areas requiring precise visual element control and composition, such as virtual e-commerce or creative content production. |
| Scaling Analysis of Interleaved Speech-Text Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02398) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.02398))| adiyoss, MajoRoth, hassid, gallilmaimon | This paper analyzes the scaling behaviour of interleaved speech-text language models (SLMs), finding they scale more efficiently than textless SLMs. The main objective is to determine if SLMs trained with interleaved speech and text data scale more efficiently with compute compared to textless SLMs. The methodology involves training dozens of interleaved SLMs across various sizes (0.5B-7B), compute budgets (2e18-2e20 FLOPs), and TextLM initialisations (e.g., Qwen2.5, Llama3.2), evaluating performance on speech-only validation loss and semantic metrics (sSC, tSC) using an ISO-FLOP curve approach. Results show interleaved SLMs scale significantly better with compute, indicating compute budgets should favour larger model sizes over more training tokens; for a 2e20 FLOP budget, a 7B parameter model trained on 4.2B tokens outperformed smaller models on more tokens, contrasting with textless SLM scaling predictions. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that when training large interleaved SLMs (e.g., >4.5B tokens), allocating more compute towards larger, high-quality pre-trained TextLM-initialised models is more efficient than towards increasing training tokens alone for improving semantic speech abilities. |
| ShortV: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models by Freezing Visual
  Tokens in Ineffective Layers (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00502) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.00502))| xphan, sanmusunrise, luyaojie, chenjiawei-icip, yuanqianhao | ShortV enhances Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) efficiency by identifying and freezing visual token computations in ineffective layers. The primary objective is to reduce the high computational overhead of MLLMs, specifically addressing redundancy in how different layers process visual tokens. A novel metric, Layer Contribution (LC), is introduced to quantify a layer's impact by measuring the KL divergence in model output logits when that layer's transformations on specific tokens (visual or text) are bypassed; ShortV uses LC to identify layers ineffective for visual tokens and replaces them with sparse layers where visual computations are frozen. Experiments demonstrate that ShortV can freeze visual token processing in approximately 60% of MLLM layers (e.g., achieving 50% FLOPs reduction on LLaVA-NeXT-13B with N=24 replaced layers) with negligible performance degradation. For AI practitioners, ShortV offers a training-free, parameter-free method to significantly decrease MLLM inference costs by exploiting layer-wise redundancy for visual tokens, and it is compatible with token pruning techniques. |

  Spaces Modeling for Natural Talking Head Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02542) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.02542))| Jun Zhou, Zixiang Zhou, danxuhk, xuzn, HarlanHong | This paper introduces ACTalker, an end-to-end video diffusion framework for natural talking head generation controlled simultaneously by audio and facial motion signals without conflict. The primary objective is to enable fine-grained control using multiple driving signals while preventing conflicts and ensuring spatio-temporal coherence. Key methodologies involve a parallel-control mamba (PCM) layer leveraging Masked Selective State Space Models (Mask-SSM) and a mask-drop strategy to direct each signal's influence to specific facial regions within a stable video diffusion architecture. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a Sync-C score of 5.317 and an FVD-Inc score of 232.374 on the CelebV-HD dataset under audio-only control, surpassing previous methods. For AI practitioners, this work presents a novel application of Mamba (SSM) structures for efficient, conflict-free multi-modal conditioning in video generation, offering precise control over synthesized facial dynamics. |
| ZClip: Adaptive Spike Mitigation for LLM Pre-Training (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02507) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.02507))| gueraf, nilabhra, louisowen6, akanyaani | ZClip introduces an adaptive gradient clipping method based on z-scores to enhance stability during large language model (LLM) pre-training. The primary objective is to mitigate gradient instability and malignant loss spikes that disrupt training, necessitating costly interventions like checkpoint restoration. ZClip dynamically adjusts the gradient clipping threshold by tracking the exponential moving average (EMA) of the gradient norm's mean and standard deviation, applying z-score-based anomaly detection to identify and scale down spikes. Experiments on a 1B LLaMA model demonstrated that ZClip enabled stable training at a high learning rate (3.0x10⁻³), reaching baseline validation loss using 18.6B fewer tokens (over 35% faster) compared to fixed clipping at a lower, stable rate (5.0x10⁻⁴). For AI practitioners, ZClip offers a method to improve LLM pre-training stability and efficiency, potentially reducing training time and compute costs by allowing for more aggressive learning rates without succumbing to catastrophic divergence. |
| Inference-Time Scaling for Generalist Reward Modeling (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02495) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.02495))| Chong Ruan, Shirong Ma, Runxin Xu, Peiyi Wang, Zijun Liu | This paper introduces Self-Principled Critique Tuning (SPCT) to enhance the inference-time scalability and performance of generalist generative reward models (GRMs). The main objective is to investigate if a specific learning method can enable effective inference-time scaling for GRMs, improving reward quality beyond standard model or compute scaling. The key methodology involves SPCT, which uses rejective fine-tuning and rule-based online RL to train GRMs to generate adaptive principles and critiques, combined with inference-time scaling via parallel sampling and voting, optionally guided by a meta RM. Primary results show DeepSeek-GRM-27B trained with SPCT achieves 69.9% overall accuracy on RM benchmarks, improving to 71.0% with voting@32, and further to 72.8% with meta RM guidance, demonstrating effective inference-time scaling compared to just increasing model size. For AI practitioners, this implies that using SPCT and inference-time sampling with GRMs can yield superior reward signals for aligning LLMs, potentially offering a more compute-efficient path to performance gains than solely relying on larger models. |
| Efficient Model Selection for Time Series Forecasting via LLMs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02119) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.02119))| Hongjie Chen, Franck-Dernoncourt, ryanrossi, tiankaiy, wwdd7718 | This paper investigates leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for efficient, zero-shot model selection in time series forecasting, eliminating the need for costly pre-computed performance matrices. The primary objective is to determine if LLMs can select optimal forecasting models and hyperparameters for unseen time series datasets solely through prompting. The methodology involves querying LLMs (Llama 3.2, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 flash) with prompts containing time series data and optionally meta-features or Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instructions to recommend a model configuration. Results demonstrate that the LLM approach, particularly Llama 3.2 using prompts with meta-features, outperforms traditional meta-learning (e.g., achieving 7.27% hit@10 accuracy vs. 4.51% for MLP) and heuristic baselines while reducing median inference time by up to 89x compared to naïve exhaustive evaluation. For AI practitioners, this suggests LLMs offer a computationally cheaper and faster alternative for selecting appropriate time series forecasting models without extensive prior model evaluations or meta-feature engineering, streamlining the model selection workflow. |
| Instruction-Guided Autoregressive Neural Network Parameter Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02012) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.02012))| Sung Ju Hwang, Song Chong, Bruno Andreis, bedio | This paper introduces IGPG, an instruction-guided autoregressive framework for generating neural network parameters conditioned on task and architecture specifications. The primary objective is to enable scalable and coherent parameter synthesis across diverse models and tasks, addressing limitations of prior methods like diffusion models. IGPG utilizes a VQ-VAE to tokenize parameters and an autoregressive transformer, conditioned on task/dataset embeddings and architecture descriptions, to generate weight tokens sequentially. Key results demonstrate competitive performance, including generating LoRA parameters that improve accuracy by up to 10% over baseline methods on vision benchmarks. For AI practitioners, IGPG offers a unified tool for rapid model initialization, efficient adaptation to new tasks, and potentially reduces the need for extensive fine-tuning by generating specialized weights on demand. |
| Interpreting Emergent Planning in Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01871) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.01871))| David Krueger, Usman Anwar, Stephen Chung, agaralon, tuphs | This paper provides the first mechanistic evidence that model-free reinforcement learning agents (DRC) learn internal planning mechanisms in Sokoban using concept-based interpretability. The primary research objective was to determine if a DRC agent internally formulates, evaluates, and utilizes plans based on predicted future consequences without an explicit world model. The methodology involved probing ConvLSTM cell states for planning-relevant concepts (Agent Approach Direction CA, Box Push Direction CB), analyzing iterative plan formation across internal ticks, and performing causal interventions on activations to verify behavioral dependence. Results show the agent linearly represents CA and CB (e.g., final layer 1x1 probe Macro F1 for CB ~0.8 vs <0.3 baseline), forms plans iteratively resembling parallelized bidirectional search which refine with extra compute (Fig 6), and interventions causally steer behavior (e.g., 98.8% success rate for Layer 3 Agent-Shortcut interventions). The principal implication for AI practitioners is that complex planning capabilities can emerge implicitly in model-free architectures, suggesting that internal state representations and iterative computation may be key mechanisms for such behaviors, influencing agent design and analysis beyond purely behavioral metrics. |
| GenPRM: Scaling Test-Time Compute of Process Reward Models via
  Generative Reasoning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00891) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.00891))| Saputello, dmux, ChetKao, iseesaw, RyanLiu112 | GenPRM introduces a generative process reward model utilizing explicit reasoning and code verification to scale test-time compute for LLM verification. The objective is to overcome limitations of current Process Reward Models (PRMs) by enhancing their process supervision capabilities and enabling test-time scaling (TTS) through generative modeling. GenPRM achieves this by performing multi-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning integrated with code generation and execution for verification, using Relative Progress Estimation (RPE) and rationale synthesis for training data generation. Experiments demonstrate that a 7B GenPRM significantly outperforms prior models, surpassing the much larger Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B on ProcessBench (achieving 80.5 F1 score with Maj@8 scaling). For AI practitioners, this work shows that smaller generative PRMs, when combined with test-time scaling, can serve as highly effective and potentially more compute-efficient verifiers or critics compared to larger models or traditional scalar-based PRMs, improving the evaluation and refinement of complex reasoning processes. |
| Scaling Laws in Scientific Discovery with AI and Robot Scientists (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22444) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.22444))| Zhenting Wang, Renjun Xu, Huazhe Xu, Heng Zhang, universea | This paper proposes the Autonomous Generalist Scientist (AGS) concept, integrating agentic AI and embodied robotics to automate the end-to-end scientific research lifecycle. The main objective is to outline a framework for AGS systems capable of independent, multi-domain scientific discovery by synergizing AI's cognitive abilities with robotics' physical interaction capabilities. The methodology involves proposing a conceptual framework featuring a five-module architecture (literature review, proposal generation, experimentation, manuscript writing, reflection/feedback) and defining five distinct levels of automation, ranging from Level 1 (Tool-Assisted) to Level 5 (Pioneer/ASIR). The paper hypothesizes new scaling laws for scientific discovery driven by AGS capabilities and number, rather than presenting empirical results; it details requirements for virtual (OS agents) and physical (embodied AI robots) task execution. For AI practitioners, the primary implication is the conceptual roadmap for developing integrated AI-robotic systems capable of complex, multi-stage, cross-domain automation, moving beyond specialized AI tools to handle tasks requiring both virtual reasoning and physical manipulation. |
| Sparse Autoencoders Learn Monosemantic Features in Vision-Language
  Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02821) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.02821))| Zeynep Akata, Serge Belongie, Quentin Bouniot, Shyamgopal Karthik, Mateusz Pach | This work extends Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP, demonstrating their ability to learn more interpretable, monosemantic features from vision representations. The primary objective is to quantitatively evaluate whether SAEs applied post-hoc to VLM activations enhance neuron monosemanticity and enable model control. Methodology involves training various SAE types on CLIP layer activations and introducing a Monosemanticity Score (MS) metric, calculating activation-weighted pairwise image embedding similarity for neurons. Results demonstrate SAE neurons achieve significantly higher monosemanticity (e.g., MS increased from 0.48 in the base VLM to 0.81 with an SAE for specific neurons shown) and reveal hierarchical concept structures, especially with Matryoshka SAEs. For AI practitioners, this research validates SAEs as an unsupervised method to interpret VLM representations and directly steer the output concepts of multimodal LLMs like LLaVA by intervening on SAE activations, without modifying the base model. |
| Whisper-LM: Improving ASR Models with Language Models for Low-Resource
  Languages (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23542) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.23542))| Ibon Saratxaga, Eva Navas, inmahernaez, zuazo | This research improves Whisper ASR models for low-resource languages by integrating external n-gram and large language models (LLMs) with fine-tuned models at inference time. The main objective was to enhance transcription accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-resource and out-of-distribution scenarios, by combining acoustic model probabilities with language model scores. Key methodology involved fine-tuning Whisper models per language, followed by integrating KenLM 5-gram models or language-specific LLMs by modifying beam search scores using optimized weighting parameters. Primary results demonstrate substantial Word Error Rate (WER) reductions, achieving up to 51% improvement for in-distribution Basque data with 5-gram models, while LLMs offered consistently robust, albeit more moderate, gains across languages. For AI practitioners, this indicates that integrating external LMs significantly boosts Whisper's performance for under-resourced languages, but optimal performance requires careful language model parameter tuning and attention to evaluation settings. |

  with Disentangled Token Merging and Quantization (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00999) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.00999))| Cheng Tan, Juanxi, ZedongWangAI, LuyuanZhang01, Lupin1998 | MergeVQ presents a unified framework integrating token merging into VQ-based models to balance visual representation learning and autoregressive generation. The primary objective is to overcome the trade-off between generation quality, representation learning, and efficiency inherent in existing VQ-MIM approaches. Key methodologies include disentangling semantics via token merging (ToMe) while preserving spatial details in a recoverable source matrix, employing Look-up Free Quantization (LFQ), using cross-attention for detail recovery, global alignment via self-distillation (DINO), and introducing MergeAR with KV Cache compression for efficient generation. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show the representation-focused variant achieves 79.8% linear probe accuracy using only 36 merged tokens, while the generative variant achieves a competitive class-conditional generation gFID of 3.05 using MergeAR. For AI practitioners, MergeVQ offers a pathway to build more computationally efficient unified vision models, as demonstrated by its ability to achieve strong representation learning performance with significantly reduced token counts (36 tokens), potentially lowering pre-training and inference costs. |
| Improved Visual-Spatial Reasoning via R1-Zero-Like Training (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00883) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.00883))| Zijian Kong, Yanhao Zhang, Qingsong Xie, Zhenyi Liao, zhijie3 | This work enhances visual-spatial reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) using R1-Zero-like GRPO training. The primary objective was to improve visual-spatial intelligence (VSI) capabilities, particularly in small- to medium-sized Qwen2-VL models where Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting proved ineffective. The key methodology involved constructing the VSI-100k dataset from ScanNet and applying Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) while identifying the necessity of retaining the KL penalty. The resulting vsGRPO-2B model outperformed its Qwen2-VL-2B base by 12.1% on the VSI-bench benchmark and surpassed GPT-4o performance. For AI practitioners, this demonstrates that GRPO training with curated datasets is a potent technique to specifically boost MLLM reasoning faculties like VSI, offering substantial gains over base models and even surpassing larger or closed-source alternatives for targeted tasks. |

  Prediction (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01014) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.01014))| Ying Shan, Jing Liao, Yixiao Ge, Yuying Ge, Howe666 | AnimeGamer introduces an MLLM-based framework for generating infinite, interactive anime life simulation games featuring dynamic video outputs and character state updates from language instructions. The primary objective is to create contextually consistent and dynamic multi-turn game states, addressing limitations of prior static image or text-only methods. The key methodology involves using an MLLM to predict novel action-aware multimodal representations from historical context and instructions, which are then decoded into video clips using a fine-tuned video diffusion model alongside character state prediction. AnimeGamer significantly outperforms baselines in quantitative evaluations, achieving higher character consistency (CLIP-I 0.8132 vs. 0.7960) and superior motion quality (ACC-F 0.6744 vs. 0.4249). For AI practitioners, this work demonstrates an effective approach using MLLMs to generate coherent, dynamic video-based interactive experiences by bridging language and video synthesis via specialized multimodal representations, enhancing immersion in generative games. |
| VideoScene: Distilling Video Diffusion Model to Generate 3D Scenes in
  One Step (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01956) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.01956))| Yueqi Duan, Jiawei Chi, Fangfu Liu, hanyang-21 | VideoScene introduces a framework to distill video diffusion models for efficient, one-step 3D scene generation from only two input images. The main objective is to bridge the gap between slow, multi-step video diffusion methods and the need for fast, 3D-consistent scene generation from sparse views. The key methodology involves a 3D-aware leap flow distillation strategy, initialized using a coarse scene from a feed-forward 3DGS model (MVSplat), and a dynamic denoising policy network (DDPNet) trained via contextual bandits to optimize leap timesteps. Primarily, VideoScene achieves significantly faster inference (~3s) while maintaining high quality; its 1-step generation on RealEstate10K yields an FVD of 103.42, vastly outperforming 1-step baselines and remaining competitive with their 50-step versions (e.g., CogVideoX-5B 50-step FVD 521.04). For AI practitioners, this offers an efficient tool for generating temporally coherent and geometrically consistent 3D video sequences from minimal input, drastically reducing computational cost for sparse-view 3D reconstruction tasks. |
| Understanding R1-Zero-Like Training: A Critical Perspective (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20783) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.20783))| Tianyu Pang, Wenjun Li, QPHutu, Cameron-Chen, lkevinzc | This paper critically analyzes R1-Zero-like LLM training, examining base model properties and RL optimization biases, particularly in GRPO. The primary objective is to understand how base model pretraining affects RL outcomes and to identify and mitigate biases in the GRPO algorithm. Methodology includes evaluating various base models (e.g., Qwen2.5, DeepSeek-V3-Base) on math benchmarks with different templates and comparing GRPO against a proposed unbiased variant, Dr. GRPO, in RL experiments. Key findings demonstrate that some base models exhibit strong initial reasoning (Qwen2.5 improves ~60% without templates), GRPO introduces length and standard deviation normalization biases impacting token efficiency, and the proposed Dr. GRPO optimizer corrects these, enabling a 7B model to achieve 43.3% accuracy on AIME 2024. The principal implication for practitioners is that understanding base model capabilities and utilizing unbiased RL optimizers like Dr. GRPO are essential for efficient reasoning enhancement, avoiding artifactual response length increases from biased optimization. |

  with Hybrid Guidance (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01724) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.01724))| Tianshu Hu, Longhao Zhang, Lizhen Wang, Zhengkun Rong, Yuxuan Luo | This paper introduces DreamActor-M1, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) based framework for robust human image animation. The primary objective is to overcome limitations in existing methods regarding fine-grained holistic control, multi-scale adaptability (portraits to full-body), and long-term temporal coherence, particularly for unseen regions. Key methodologies include using hybrid motion guidance signals (implicit facial latent representations, 3D head spheres, 3D body skeletons with bone length adjustment), complementary appearance guidance for unseen areas, and a progressive multi-scale training strategy. The proposed method achieved superior quantitative results, for instance, an FVD score of 122.0 on their collected body animation dataset, outperforming prior works like Animate Anyone (158.3) and MimicMotion (149.9). For AI practitioners, this work demonstrates a robust DiT-based approach with hybrid explicit/implicit controls and appearance guidance, enabling the generation of higher-fidelity, more expressive, and temporally consistent human animations across diverse scales and viewpoints. |
| PaperBench: Evaluating AI's Ability to Replicate AI Research (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01848) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.01848))| Jun Shern Chan, James Aung, Dane Sherburn, Oliver Jaffe, Giulio Starace | PaperBench introduces a benchmark to evaluate AI agents' ability to replicate state-of-the-art AI research papers from scratch. The objective is to assess how well AI agents can understand paper contributions, develop codebases, and execute experiments to reproduce empirical results. The methodology involves providing agents with 20 ICML 2024 papers and using detailed, author-approved hierarchical rubrics alongside an LLM-based judge to evaluate the agent-generated code repository and its execution outputs. Results show the best agent, Claude 3.5 Sonnet with scaffolding, achieved an average replication score of 21.0%, significantly lower than a human expert baseline (41.4% on a subset), indicating current models have limited autonomous AI R&D replication capabilities. For AI practitioners, this highlights that while agents show nascent ability, they are not yet proficient at the complex, long-horizon task of independently replicating and validating frontier AI research, requiring substantial human oversight for such tasks. |

  Accurate Citations (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00824) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.00824))| Zhiheng Lyu, Huaye Zeng, Ping Nie, Xueguang Ma, Yubo Wang | ScholarCopilot introduces a unified framework for training LLMs to generate academic text with accurate, context-aware citations. The main objective is to overcome limitations of traditional RAG systems by integrating dynamic retrieval directly into the generation process for improved citation relevance and quality in academic writing. The methodology involves dynamically generating special retrieval tokens ([RET]) during text generation, using their representations for similarity search against a database, and feeding retrieved references back into the model, optimizing generation and retrieval jointly. ScholarCopilot achieved 40.1% top-1 retrieval accuracy, significantly outperforming E5-Mistral-7B-Instruct (15.0%), and obtained a generation quality score of 16.2/25, surpassing larger models like Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct (15.8/25).

| Towards Physically Plausible Video Generation via VLM Planning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23368) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.23368))| Lei Bai, Zhenfei Yin, Yiming Zhang, Baolu Li, Xindi Yang | This paper proposes a two-stage framework using a Vision Language Model (VLM) planner and a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) synthesizer to generate physically plausible videos. The objective is to enhance physical plausibility in video generation by explicitly incorporating physics priors, addressing the limitations of standard VDMs in understanding physical laws. The methodology involves a VLM performing coarse-grained, physics-aware motion planning via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to predict rough object trajectories, which then guide a VDM through injected structured noise derived from optical flow for fine-level motion synthesis. Quantitative results on the PhyGenBench benchmark show the proposed method achieved an average score of 0.60, outperforming the best compared image-to-video method (SG-I2V at 0.54) by 11.1% in physical plausibility assessment. For AI practitioners, this demonstrates a method to integrate explicit physical reasoning from VLMs into VDMs to improve the realism and physical consistency of generated video content, particularly for scenarios involving object interactions governed by physics. |
| ILLUME+: Illuminating Unified MLLM with Dual Visual Tokenization and
  Diffusion Refinement (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01934) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.01934))| Yunlong Yuan, Guansong Lu, Junwei Yang, Chunwei Wang, Runhui Huang | ILLUME+ enhances unified Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by integrating dual visual tokenization and diffusion refinement for improved understanding, generation, and editing. The objective is to create a single MLLM that overcomes limitations of prior models, such as poor texture preservation in editing or weaker semantic understanding, by effectively unifying these three core capabilities. Key methodologies include the DualViTok tokenizer preserving both semantic and texture details, a diffusion model decoder for high-fidelity image reconstruction and super-resolution, and a coarse-to-fine image representation strategy within the MLLM. Primary results show the 3B parameter ILLUME+ achieves competitive performance across understanding, generation, and editing benchmarks, including an improved Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) of 6.00 on the MJHQ-30k generation benchmark compared to its predecessor. For AI practitioners, this work presents a unified model architecture that supports flexible resolution inputs/outputs and demonstrates strong performance in fine-grained editing tasks, potentially offering a more versatile foundation for complex, interactive multimodal applications. |
| Articulated Kinematics Distillation from Video Diffusion Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01204) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.01204))| Chenfanfu Jiang, Yongxin Chen, Tsung-Yi Lin, Qianli Ma, Xuan Li | Articulated Kinematics Distillation (AKD) synthesizes articulated motions for rigged 3D assets by leveraging video diffusion models. The objective is to generate high-fidelity, structurally consistent character animations from text prompts, addressing limitations of prior text-to-4D methods based on neural deformation fields. AKD utilizes a low-DoF skeleton-based representation optimized via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) with a pre-trained video diffusion model, incorporating explicit ground rendering and optional physics-based motion tracking. Experiments show AKD outperforms TC4D, achieving higher automated scores (e.g., Semantic Adherence 0.81±0.26 vs 0.40±0.34) and preference in user studies for motion quality and physical plausibility. For AI practitioners, AKD offers a method to generate controllable, physically grounded 3D character animations from text by effectively combining generative video priors with explicit articulated structure, improving consistency over deformation field approaches. |
| Safeguarding Vision-Language Models: Mitigating Vulnerabilities to
  Gaussian Noise in Perturbation-based Attacks (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01308) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.01308))| Zhendong Liu, Yushen Zuo, sofyc, AllenChai, Jarvis1111 | This paper investigates Vision-Language Model (VLM) vulnerability to Gaussian noise perturbations and proposes noise-augmented fine-tuning and a diffusion-based defense (DiffPure-VLM) to mitigate these risks. The primary objective is to systematically analyze VLM robustness against visual Gaussian noise and develop effective defense strategies against both simple noise and optimization-based adversarial attacks while preserving model helpfulness. Key methodologies include creating the Robust-VLGuard dataset with aligned/misaligned safety pairs, employing Gaussian noise augmentation during safety fine-tuning, and proposing the DiffPure-VLM pipeline which uses diffusion models to transform adversarial perturbations into Gaussian-like noise manageable by the fine-tuned VLMs. Primary results demonstrate that while baseline VLMs degrade significantly under Gaussian noise, the proposed noise-augmented fine-tuning enhances robustness, and DiffPure-VLM substantially reduces optimization-based attack success rates; for example, with InternVL2-8B-RobustVLGuard under a €=32/255 attack, DiffPure-VLM (t*=50) lowered the attack success rate from 70.6% to 33.4%. For AI practitioners, this implies that incorporating noise-augmented safety fine-tuning and employing diffusion-based preprocessing defenses like DiffPure-VLM are practical strategies to significantly bolster VLM security against visual perturbation attacks without excessive computational overhead or loss of core functionality. |
| Boost Your Own Human Image Generation Model via Direct Preference
  Optimization with AI Feedback (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20216) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2405.20216))| Hyunjoon Lee, Yonggyu Kim, sanghyeonna | This paper introduces HG-DPO, a method enhancing human image generation realism by applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with real images and curriculum learning. The main objective is to improve diffusion models for human image synthesis by overcoming the limitations of standard DPO, which typically relies only on generated images. HG-DPO utilizes a novel preference structure where real images serve as preferred (winning) examples and generated images as non-preferred (losing), combined with a three-stage curriculum learning pipeline (easy, normal, hard) and AI feedback for dataset construction. Results demonstrate HG-DPO significantly outperforms baseline models and prior DPO methods, achieving a lower FID of 29.41 compared to the base model's 37.34 and higher CI-S of 0.9858 versus 0.9573. For AI practitioners, this provides a framework to boost the quality and realism of text-to-human image generation models by effectively integrating real-world image data into the preference learning process without costly human annotation, and enhances personalized generation tasks. |
| DASH: Detection and Assessment of Systematic Hallucinations of VLMs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23573) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.23573))| Matthias Hein, Maximilian Augustin, YanNeu | This paper introduces DASH, an automated pipeline for detecting systematic false-positive object hallucinations in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using large-scale, real-world image data. The main objective is to systematically identify clusters of semantically similar real-world images that cause a VLM to incorrectly affirm the presence of an object not actually depicted. Key methodologies include DASH-LLM, which uses LLM-generated text queries for image retrieval, and DASH-OPT, which optimizes latent diffusion model inputs to generate misleading images, both followed by k-NN retrieval on ReLAION-5B and clustering. Applying DASH to PaliGemma and two LLaVA-NeXT models across 380 objects yielded over 19k hallucination clusters containing over 950k images; fine-tuning PaliGemma on DASH-identified images improved accuracy on the derived DASH-B benchmark by 11.6%. For AI practitioners, this work highlights that significant object hallucination issues persist beyond standard benchmarks, necessitating open-world testing methods like DASH for reliable VLM assessment and providing datasets (DASH-B) for more rigorous evaluation and potential mitigation fine-tuning. |
| LSNet: See Large, Focus Small (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23135) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.23135))| Guiguang Ding, Jungong Han, Zijia Lin, Hui Chen, jameslahm | LSNet introduces a lightweight vision network family leveraging a novel LS convolution inspired by the human vision system's "See Large, Focus Small" strategy. The primary objective is to enhance the performance and efficiency balance in lightweight models by improving the token mixing process, specifically perception and aggregation under limited computational budgets. The key methodology involves the proposed LS (Large-Small) convolution, which uses large-kernel static depth-wise convolution for broad perception and small-kernel grouped dynamic convolution for adaptive, focused aggregation. Results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance; for instance, LSNet-B achieves 80.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with 1.3G FLOPs, outperforming comparable models like AFFNet and RepViT-M1.1 in both accuracy and efficiency. For AI practitioners, LSNet provides a new efficient architectural block (LS convolution) and model series offering improved accuracy-efficiency trade-offs for vision tasks deployed on resource-constrained platforms. |
| VerifiAgent: a Unified Verification Agent in Language Model Reasoning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00406) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.00406))| Ehsan Shareghi, Wray Buntine, Jiuzhou Han | This paper introduces VerifiAgent, a unified agent employing two verification levels (meta and tool-based adaptive) to enhance large language model (LLM) reasoning reliability. The main research objective is to develop a generalisable and efficient verification framework for diverse LLM reasoning tasks, overcoming the limitations of current methods. VerifiAgent utilizes a two-layer methodology involving meta-verification for completeness and consistency, followed by tool-based adaptive verification which autonomously selects external tools (e.g., Python interpreter, search engine, symbolic solver) based on the reasoning type. Experimental results show VerifiAgent outperforms baseline verification methods across mathematical, logical, commonsense, and hybrid reasoning tasks, achieving 0.96 accuracy on GSM8K compared to baselines like deductive verifier (0.95). For AI practitioners, VerifiAgent offers a plug-and-play framework to improve the reliability and accuracy of LLM reasoning outputs, particularly in inference scaling scenarios, achieving better results with fewer samples and lower cost than methods like PRMs. |
| Enhanced OoD Detection through Cross-Modal Alignment of Multi-Modal
  Representations (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18817) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.18817))| Sangheum Hwang, mawjdgus | This paper introduces Cross-Modal Alignment (CMA), a multi-modal fine-tuning method to enhance Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection in vision-language models. The primary objective is to improve OoD performance by mitigating the modality gap observed between image and text embeddings during standard fine-tuning. CMA employs a regularization loss during fine-tuning to explicitly align in-distribution image-text embedding pairs in the hyperspherical representation space, shown theoretically to correspond to maximizing the log-likelihood of a joint energy-based model. The proposed CMA method, when combined with the NegLabel scoring function, achieved state-of-the-art OoD performance on the MOS benchmark, attaining an average FPR95 of 19.93% and 95.13% AUROC, significantly outperforming existing zero-shot and fine-tuning approaches while maintaining high ID accuracy (82.64% on ImageNet-1k). For AI practitioners, this work demonstrates that explicitly regularizing for cross-modal alignment during fine-tuning can substantially improve model robustness by enhancing both OoD detection and in-distribution classification, thereby increasing the reliability of VLMs deployed in open environments. |

| Any2Caption:Interpreting Any Condition to Caption for Controllable Video
  Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24379) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.24379))| shuicheng, dizhang, Xintao, WeicaiYe, ChocoWu | Any2Caption introduces an MLLM-based framework to interpret diverse multimodal conditions into structured captions for controllable video generation. The main objective is to accurately interpret complex user intent from various inputs (text, images, specialized cues like pose/camera) to improve video synthesis control and quality. The methodology involves decoupling interpretation from generation, using a Qwen2-LLM with dedicated encoders to generate detailed, structured captions, trained on the new Any2CapIns dataset (337K instances). Results show high caption fidelity (e.g., 91.95 BERTSCORE) and improved video quality and controllability when integrated with existing video generators across various conditions. For AI practitioners, the key implication is the ability to enhance control over existing video generation models using complex multimodal inputs by integrating this interpretation module, which outputs structured text captions, without needing to retrain the core video generator. |
| Exploring the Effect of Reinforcement Learning on Video Understanding:
  Insights from SEED-Bench-R1 (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24376) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.24376))| yshan2u, yxgeee, ruiwang, tttoaster, ChenYi99 | SEED-Bench-R1 is introduced to systematically evaluate reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for multimodal large language model (MLLM) video understanding. The primary objective is to compare the effectiveness and generalization of RL (specifically GRPO) against supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for video tasks requiring both perception and logical reasoning. Using Qwen2-VL-Instruct-7B, the study compared GRPO trained with outcome-based rewards against SFT on the hierarchical SEED-Bench-R1 benchmark (L1: In-distribution, L2/L3: OOD). Results show GRPO significantly outperforms SFT in data efficiency and generalization, particularly in OOD scenarios (e.g., 44.89% vs 38.15% accuracy on Level-3), and extends generalization benefits to benchmarks like LongVideoBench (43.40% vs 40.00%). For AI practitioners, this implies RL, even with simple outcome rewards, is highly effective at enhancing MLLM visual perception and OOD generalization for video tasks compared to SFT, though analysis notes RL may compromise logical coherence in the reasoning chain. |
| CodeARC: Benchmarking Reasoning Capabilities of LLM Agents for Inductive
  Program Synthesis (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23145) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.23145))| Naveen Kannan, Jiannan Cao, kaiyan289, tarsur909, anjiangwei | This paper introduces CodeARC, an interactive benchmark evaluating LLM agents on inductive program synthesis. The main objective is to assess LLMs' ability to infer hidden functions solely from input-output examples through interaction, departing from static evaluation protocols. Key methodology involves agents querying a hidden target function, synthesizing candidates, and using a differential testing oracle for feedback and iterative refinement under budget constraints on 1114 Python functions. Primary results indicate the task is challenging: the best-performing model, o3-mini, achieved a 52.7% success rate on the anonymized dataset, and fine-tuning LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct improved performance by up to 31% relatively. For AI practitioners, this work provides a more realistic benchmark revealing significant limitations in current LLMs' inductive reasoning for code synthesis and suggests interactive refinement and targeted fine-tuning as avenues for improvement. |
| JudgeLRM: Large Reasoning Models as a Judge (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00050) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.00050))| Jiaying Wu, Nuo Chen, bhooi, qingyunzou, zhiyuanhucs | This paper introduces JudgeLRM, a family of LLMs trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to serve as evaluators, specifically targeting complex reasoning tasks where SFT judges falter. The research investigates whether enhancing reasoning capabilities improves LLM judge performance and proposes an RL-based training approach using judge-wise, outcome-driven rewards. Key methodology involves training base LLMs (Qwen2.5) using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a custom reward function combining structural correctness and content alignment (relation, absolute, confidence metrics) against ground-truth judgments. Primary results show JudgeLRM models outperform SFT-tuned and state-of-the-art reasoning models; notably, JudgeLRM-7B surpasses DeepSeek-R1 by 2.79% in F1 score on the JudgeLM benchmark, excelling particularly on tasks requiring deep reasoning. For AI practitioners, this implies that RL with carefully designed, reasoning-focused rewards is a more effective method than SFT for developing robust LLM evaluators capable of handling nuanced, complex judgment tasks, suggesting RL should be considered for building reliable automated evaluation systems. |
| GeometryCrafter: Consistent Geometry Estimation for Open-world Videos
  with Diffusion Priors (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01016) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.01016))| Xiaoyu Li, yshan2u, wbhu-tc, xiangjun0211, slothfulxtx | GeometryCrafter generates temporally consistent, metrically accurate point map sequences from open-world videos using diffusion priors. The main objective is to estimate high-fidelity, temporally coherent point maps with correct metric scale from videos, overcoming the affine ambiguity and temporal inconsistency limitations of prior diffusion-based depth and geometry estimation methods. The key methodology employs a novel point map Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a dual-encoder design (using an inherited SVD encoder and a residual encoder) to encode unbounded point maps while maintaining latent compatibility, integrated with a video diffusion model finetuned using these latents and per-frame geometry priors. Primary results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average rank of 1.9 on point map estimation across seven diverse benchmark datasets, indicating superior 3D accuracy and temporal consistency compared to previous methods. For AI practitioners, this provides a framework to extract metrically accurate, temporally consistent geometry from videos, directly usable for applications like 3D/4D reconstruction or depth-conditioned video editing/generation without post-hoc scale recovery. |
| Agent S2: A Compositional Generalist-Specialist Framework for Computer
  Use Agents (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00906) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.00906))| Vincent Tu, Kyle Wong, xw-eric, jc-y42, saa1605 | Agent S2 introduces a compositional generalist-specialist framework enhancing computer use agent capabilities via specialized modules. The primary objective is to address limitations in GUI grounding precision, long-horizon task planning, and reliance on single generalist models for diverse cognitive tasks. Methodologically, Agent S2 employs a Mixture-of-Grounding technique routing actions to specialized grounding experts and Proactive Hierarchical Planning for dynamic plan refinement based on evolving observations. Agent S2 achieved new state-of-the-art results, notably a 34.5% success rate on the OSWorld 50-step evaluation, a 32.7% relative improvement over the leading Claude Computer Use baseline. For AI practitioners, this demonstrates the effectiveness of composing generalist planning with specialized grounding modules to overcome bottlenecks in monolithic models for complex GUI automation tasks. |
| Z1: Efficient Test-time Scaling with Code (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00810) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.00810))| Xiao-Ping Zhang, armanc, yilunzhao, yh1567, zjy2001 | Z1 proposes an efficient test-time compute scaling method for LLMs using code-related reasoning trajectories and a novel shifted thinking window. The research aims to reduce the excessive thinking token cost associated with test-time scaling in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) while preserving performance. Key methodology involves training an LLM (Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct) on a curated dataset (Z1-Code-Reasoning-107K) containing both short and long code solution trajectories and employing a "Shifted Thinking Window" during inference that avoids fixed delimiters and caps reasoning tokens. The resulting model, Z1-7B, matches the performance of R1-Distill-Qwen-7B on three reasoning benchmarks while using only about 30% of its average thinking tokens, and notably generalizes to non-code tasks like GPQA Diamond (47.5%). For AI practitioners, this demonstrates a method to significantly improve the computational efficiency and reduce inference costs of LRMs for complex reasoning tasks by fine-tuning with varied-length code trajectories and adopting a flexible, adaptive thinking process during inference. |
| MixerMDM: Learnable Composition of Human Motion Diffusion Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01019) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.01019))| José García-Rodríguez, Sergio Escalera, Cristina Palmero, Germs96, pabloruizponce | MixerMDM introduces a learnable technique for composing pre-trained text-conditioned human motion diffusion models. The main research objective is to dynamically combine motions from specialized single-person and interaction models to achieve fine-grained control over individual movements within complex interactions. The key methodology involves a lightweight `Mixer` module, trained adversarially against multiple discriminators (one per pre-trained model), to predict dynamic, context-dependent mixing weights at each denoising step, using the pre-trained models' outputs as pseudo-ground truth. Primary results demonstrate superior performance over fixed-weight or scheduled methods, with MixerMDM achieving significantly better alignment and consistency, ranking first in 85.14% of user study comparisons based on motion alignment to textual descriptions. For AI practitioners, MixerMDM provides a modular framework to combine specialized, pre-trained diffusion models for generating nuanced, controllable human motion sequences without requiring retraining of the base models or explicit ground truth for the combined outputs. |
| Open-Qwen2VL: Compute-Efficient Pre-Training of Fully-Open Multimodal
  LLMs on Academic Resources (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00595) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.00595))| Heng Wang, Yu Tian, windwest, yanglj55, weizhiwang | Open-Qwen2VL details compute-efficient pre-training of a fully open-source 2B parameter Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) on academic-scale resources. The objective is to develop and openly release an efficient MLLM pre-training pipeline reproducible with limited compute, specifically using 8xA100-40G GPUs. Key methodologies include low-to-high dynamic image resolution (144 visual tokens in pre-training, 729 in SFT), multimodal sequence packing, and data filtering using both CLIP-based methods and MLLM-based techniques (MLM-Filter) on a 29M image-text pair dataset. The resulting instruction-tuned Open-Qwen2VL, pre-trained on 5B packed multimodal tokens (using 442 A100-40G GPU hours), outperforms the partially-open Qwen2-VL-2B on benchmarks such as MMBench (achieving 80.9), SEEDBench, MMStar, and MathVista, despite using only 0.36% of Qwen2-VL's reported pre-training tokens. For AI practitioners, this work provides a fully open-sourced blueprint—including codebase, data filtering/packing scripts, curated pre-training data, and model checkpoints—demonstrating that efficient, high-performance MLLM pre-training is attainable without extensive industrial-scale resources, enabled by optimized data curation and training techniques. |
| Harnessing the Reasoning Economy: A Survey of Efficient Reasoning for
  Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24377) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.24377))| Sudanl, pangjh3, BeyondHsueh, Merlin-Hongru, Ray121381 | This survey systematically reviews strategies for achieving "Reasoning Economy" in Large Language Models (LLMs), balancing performance benefits against computational budgets. The primary objective is to analyze the causes of reasoning inefficiency (e.g., length bias, deceptive behaviors), understand different reasoning patterns, and survey potential solutions across post-training and test-time inference stages. It employs a comprehensive literature review, categorizing challenges stemming from post-training methods (like Superficial Alignment leading to length bias) and test-time usage (like unreasonable computation allocation) and corresponding optimization solutions (e.g., behavior regulation, usage improvement). Key findings identify specific inefficiencies like length bias (where RMs may prefer longer responses, e.g., 63.1% in RLCD) and overly cautious reasoning, while highlighting solutions such as long2short RL methods (e.g., SimPO reducing lengths by 30-40%) and adaptive computation allocation based on task complexity. For AI practitioners, the principal implication is the need to shift from static, one-size-fits-all inference approaches towards dynamic, adaptive strategies (e.g., adaptive budget allocation, algorithm selection) to optimize resource utilization and unlock LLMs' full potential efficiently. |
| OmniMMI: A Comprehensive Multi-modal Interaction Benchmark in Streaming
  Video Contexts (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22952) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.22952))| Tong Wu, Bo Chen, Yueqian Wang, zlzheng, ColorfulAI | This paper introduces OmniMMI, a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in streaming video interaction, and M4, a framework enhancing these capabilities. The primary objective is to evaluate and improve the real-world interactive performance of OmniLLMs in streaming video contexts, focusing on streaming understanding and proactive reasoning challenges underexplored by existing benchmarks. Methodology involved curating the OmniMMI dataset (1,121 videos, 2,290 questions across six subtasks including dynamic state grounding and proactive alerting) and developing the Multi-modal Multiplexing Modeling (M4) framework using multiplexing techniques and an attention-based inference method for efficient, proactive processing. Experimental results show existing MLLMs perform poorly on OmniMMI, particularly struggling with proactive tasks and multi-turn dependencies, while the proposed lightweight M4 model demonstrates significant improvement, achieving 68.5% accuracy on the Proactive Turn-taking task after audio adaptation (M4-a). For AI practitioners, this research underscores the inadequacy of current models for real-time interaction, provides OmniMMI as a necessary tool for evaluating streaming/proactive capabilities, and suggests the M4 architecture as a resource-efficient approach to develop models that can simultaneously perceive and generate responses in dynamic environments. |
| Command A: An Enterprise-Ready Large Language Model (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00698) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.00698))| salthammer, yazeed7, jayalammar, ArashAhmadian, aakanksha | This report details Command A, a 111B parameter multilingual large language model optimized for enterprise RAG and agentic tasks, alongside the smaller Command R7B. The primary objective was to develop and evaluate Command A and R7B as efficient, high-performing LLMs tailored for real-world enterprise settings, focusing on multilingualism, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and tool use. Key methodologies include a decentralised post-training strategy combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) across specialized expert models, followed by parameter merging (linear soup), and a polishing phase using algorithms like Self-improving Robust Preference Optimisation (SRPO). Command A achieves competitive results, scoring 80.0 on the MATH benchmark and 51.7 on Taubench, while maintaining efficiency by requiring only two A100/H100 GPUs for inference and delivering up to 156 tokens/sec. For AI practitioners, Command A offers an efficient foundation for enterprise applications needing strong RAG and agentic capabilities, while the reported decentralised training and merging approach presents a method for integrating diverse expert functionalities into a single model. |
| Recitation over Reasoning: How Cutting-Edge Language Models Can Fail on
  Elementary School-Level Reasoning Problems? (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00509) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.00509))| Xuesong Yao, xmerge123, ALEXoDu, yfxu, kaiyan289 | This paper demonstrates that cutting-edge LLMs often recite solutions rather than genuinely reason, even on elementary problems. The research objective was to determine if LLMs possess true reasoning ability or merely replicate patterns seen during training, particularly when faced with subtly altered conditions. A novel multi-modal benchmark, RoR-Bench, was created featuring pairs of original problems and variants with minor but crucial condition shifts. Empirical analysis revealed severe recitation behavior, with top models like OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 experiencing performance drops exceeding 60% on modified elementary arithmetic and reasoning problems compared to their original counterparts. For AI practitioners, this highlights a critical need to re-evaluate LLM intelligence claims and emphasizes that current models may lack robustness, potentially failing unexpectedly when encountering slight deviations from learned patterns. |
| AdaMMS: Model Merging for Heterogeneous Multimodal Large Language Models
  with Unsupervised Coefficient Optimization (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23733) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.23733))| Yiru Wang, Jiabo Ye, Xiaochen Wang, Yiyang Du, carboncoo | AdaMMS introduces an unsupervised method for merging heterogeneous Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with differing architectures. The primary objective is to effectively combine capabilities from distinct MLLMs without requiring labeled data for optimizing the merging hyperparameters. The methodology involves parameter mapping to align weights, linear interpolation for merging, and an unsupervised search step that selects the optimal interpolation coefficient based on minimizing generation consistency differences across candidate merged models using a small unlabeled dataset. Experiments show AdaMMS outperforms supervised baselines; for example, merging LLaVA-OneVision-7B into Qwen2-VL-7B yielded a SUM score of 563.56, a +26.84 gain over the original models' average. AI practitioners can leverage AdaMMS to fuse heterogeneous MLLMs efficiently, creating enhanced models without supervised data by using generation consistency as a proxy for task performance during optimization. |
| When To Solve, When To Verify: Compute-Optimal Problem Solving and
  Generative Verification for LLM Reasoning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01005) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.01005))| anna-rohrbach, kaiweichang, adityagrover, arianhosseini, hbXNov | This research compares the compute-efficiency of Self-Consistency (SC) and Generative Reward Models (GenRM) for LLM reasoning, revealing SC's superiority at lower budgets. The study investigates whether allocating a fixed inference budget towards generating more solutions (SC) or generating fewer solutions with multiple verifications (GenRM) yields better LLM reasoning performance, and how to optimally balance solutions and verifications for GenRM. A compute-matched analysis compared SC and GenRM across various models, tasks, and budgets, calculating FLOPs based on solution (S) and verification (V) generation; inference scaling laws were derived by fitting optimal solution (S_opt) and verification (V_opt) counts to compute budget C. Primary results show SC outperforms GenRM until high compute budgets are reached; for Llama-3.1-8B on MATH, GenRM required 8x the compute of SC to match its performance and 128x to achieve a 3.8% gain, while compute-optimal GenRM requires scaling solutions faster (S_opt ∝ C^0.57) than verifications (V_opt ∝ C^0.39). AI practitioners should prioritize SC for LLM reasoning under typical compute constraints; if using GenRM at high budgets, allocate compute preferentially towards increasing solution count over verification count per solution for optimal efficiency. |
| Scaling Language-Free Visual Representation Learning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01017) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.01017))| liuzhuang13, koustuvs, JiachenZhu, tsbpp, davidfan97 | This paper investigates scaling language-free visual self-supervised learning (SSL) on web-scale data, comparing its performance against Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) primarily on Visual Question Answering (VQA). The research aims to determine if visual SSL lags behind CLIP due to the absence of language supervision or disparities in training data. Key methodology involves training DINOv2 (SSL) and CLIP models (1B to 7B parameters) on the identical 2 billion sample MetaCLIP dataset and evaluating using the Cambrian-1 VQA suite and traditional vision benchmarks. Primary results indicate visual SSL scales better with model and data size than CLIP on VQA; specifically, a 7B parameter Web-DINO model trained on 8 billion examples outperforms a comparable CLIP model on average VQA performance across 16 tasks. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that appropriately scaled visual SSL can yield vision encoders competitive with language-supervised models for multimodal tasks like VQA, providing a strong vision-centric alternative without needing paired text data during pretraining. |
| Multi-Token Attention (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00927) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.00927))| sainbar, spermwhale, Tianlu, Golovneva | This paper introduces Multi-Token Attention (MTA), enhancing LLM attention by conditioning weights on multiple query and key vectors simultaneously via convolution operations. The primary objective is to overcome the "single token attention" bottleneck, allowing models to locate relevant context using richer, multi-token criteria rather than single vector similarity. MTA modifies standard attention by applying convolutions across query, key, and head dimensions (termed key-query convolution and head mixing convolution), often coupled with group normalization. Experiments demonstrate MTA achieves lower perplexity on language modeling (11.09 avg PPL vs 11.25 for an 880M Transformer baseline) and notably improves performance on long-context tasks like Needle-in-a-Haystack and BabiLong compared to baselines. For AI practitioners, MTA offers a method to improve model performance in scenarios requiring identification of context based on multiple simultaneous conditions, particularly beneficial for long-context reasoning, by incorporating these convolutional modifications into the attention mechanism. |
| Efficient LLaMA-3.2-Vision by Trimming Cross-attended Visual Features (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00557) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.00557))| Jaeyeon Kim, Donguk Lim, Seungmin Yang, Ki-Ung Song, Jewon Lee | This paper presents Trimmed Llama, a method for improving inference efficiency in cross-attention-based Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by pruning visual features. The main objective is to mitigate the computational bottleneck caused by the large Key-Value (KV) cache size associated with image tokens in cross-attention layers. The key methodology involves exploiting the sparsity and inter-layer resemblance of cross-attention patterns, using head-wise attention scores from the first cross-attention layer to selectively prune redundant visual features for subsequent layers. Primary results show that Trimmed Llama can reduce visual feature usage by up to 50% (e.g., Kratio=0.15 retaining ~41.6% features for the 11B model) while maintaining performance parity with baseline Llama-3.2-Vision models on benchmarks like MME and LLaVA-Bench, alongside reduced inference latency (e.g., 14.2% reduction for batch size 16). For AI practitioners, this provides a training-free technique to decrease inference latency and memory consumption for cross-attention LVLMs with minimal impact on task performance. |
| Inference-Time Scaling for Complex Tasks: Where We Stand and What Lies
  Ahead (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00294) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.00294))| Neel Joshi, Shivam Garg, Lingjiao Chen, Jingya Chen, Vidhisha Balachandran | This extensive empirical study evaluates the benefits and limitations of inference-time scaling methods across diverse complex tasks for large language models (LLMs). The main objective was to investigate how scaling performance, including accuracy and token usage tradeoffs, varies across nine state-of-the-art conventional and reasoning-tuned models on eight challenging benchmarks (e.g., math, NP-hard problems, planning, spatial reasoning). Key methodologies included evaluating models using standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT), parallel scaling (sampling N generations with aggregators like best-of-N), and sequential scaling (iterative refinement with self-critique), approximating performance bounds. Primary results show inference-time scaling benefits vary significantly by task and diminish with complexity; notably, increased token consumption does not reliably yield higher accuracy across models (e.g., on AIME 25, DeepSeek R1 used >5x more tokens than Claude 3.7 Sonnet for <3% accuracy difference). The principal implication for AI practitioners is that leveraging inference-time compute requires careful task-specific consideration and highlights the critical need for developing robust, efficient verifiers and adaptive scaling strategies, as current approaches show inconsistent gains and cost nondeterminism. |
| Discovering Knowledge Deficiencies of Language Models on Massive
  Knowledge Base (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23361) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.23361))| Ryotaro Shimizu, Jieyu Zhang, Xuwei Ding, MaksimSTW, linxinso | This paper introduces Stochastic Error Ascent (SEA), a scalable framework for efficiently discovering factual knowledge deficiencies in closed-weight LLMs against massive knowledge bases under budget constraints. The primary objective is to develop a scalable and budget-constrained method for automatically uncovering knowledge deficiencies (errors) in closed-weight LLMs by evaluating them against large knowledge bases. The core methodology, SEA, uses stochastic optimization to iteratively retrieve knowledge base paragraphs semantically similar to prior LLM failures, employing hierarchical retrieval and a relation DAG to guide the search efficiently. Empirically, SEA uncovered 40.7× more knowledge errors than the Automated Capability Discovery baseline and 26.7% more than AutoBencher, while significantly reducing the cost-per-error. For AI practitioners, SEA provides a cost-effective method to pinpoint specific factual weaknesses in LLMs, enabling targeted improvements through data curation or fine-tuning to enhance model reliability. |
| m1: Unleash the Potential of Test-Time Scaling for Medical Reasoning
  with Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00869) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.00869))| Yuyin Zhou, Xianfeng Tang, Hui Liu, Juncheng Wu, Xiaoke Huang | This paper introduces m1, a method applying test-time scaling to enhance the medical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The primary objective was to investigate the effectiveness of test-time scaling for medical QA, contrasting it with mathematical reasoning tasks. The methodology involved curating medical QA datasets (m1K, m23K), fine-tuning Qwen2.5 models (7B, 32B) on these datasets using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and controlling the "thinking" token budget during inference. Results show that increasing the thinking budget improves accuracy (e.g., m1-7B-23K achieved 60.32% average accuracy), but plateaus around 4K tokens; budget forcing offered limited benefits, and performance gains were ultimately constrained by the model's inherent medical knowledge. For AI practitioners, this implies that while test-time scaling enhances medical reasoning, it is insufficient alone; complementing it with improved knowledge grounding via high-quality data curation and larger model capacity is essential for further performance gains, especially on complex medical tasks. |

| Towards Trustworthy GUI Agents: A Survey (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23434) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.23434))| Ninghao Liu, Wenhu Chen, Wenlin Yao, Wenhao Yu, Yucheng Shi | This survey reviews the critical dimensions of trustworthiness for GUI agents interacting with digital interfaces via foundation models. The paper's objective is to systematically examine security vulnerabilities, reliability, explainability, ethical considerations, and evaluation methodologies pertinent to GUI agent trustworthiness. It employs a literature survey methodology, categorizing research into five key trustworthiness areas and summarizing existing attacks (e.g., WebPI, AEIA-MN), defenses (e.g., GuardAgent, CLEAR), and evaluation frameworks (e.g., ST-WebAgentBench, Agent-SafetyBench). Key findings identify significant security vulnerabilities, such as environmental injection attacks achieving up to 93% success rates (AEIA-MN), alongside challenges in reliability (hallucination) and privacy, while noting that current research often overlooks these aspects for functional performance. For AI practitioners, this necessitates a shift from solely optimizing task completion towards implementing holistic, multi-layered defenses, robust evaluation benchmarks incorporating safety metrics, and user-centric transparency mechanisms to ensure secure and responsible GUI agent deployment. |

  Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24235) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.24235))| nancy-zwx, demolei, RubinSun, silentspring2, DonJoey | This survey introduces a unified four-dimensional framework (what, how, where, how well) to systematically organize and analyze research on Test-Time Scaling (TTS) in Large Language Models. Its objective is to address the lack of a comprehensive overview by categorizing TTS methods, applications, and evaluation metrics, identifying trends, and outlining future directions. The paper proposes a multi-axis taxonomy and conducts an extensive literature review, decomposing techniques like parallel, sequential, hybrid, and internal scaling, alongside tuning-based (SFT, RL) and inference-based (stimulation, verification, search, aggregation) implementation strategies. The review confirms TTS significantly enhances LLM performance across various tasks, observing scaling-law-like improvements with increased compute, and highlights specific techniques like internal scaling via RL (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) or search methods yielding efficiency gains (e.g., ETS achieving 1.8x KV cache reduction). AI practitioners can utilize the taxonomy and guidelines (Section 7) to select, combine, and evaluate complementary TTS strategies (e.g., Self-Consistency, MCTS, STaR, internal scaling) for balancing performance, cost, and task-specific requirements in LLM deployment. |
| Open-Reasoner-Zero: An Open Source Approach to Scaling Up Reinforcement
  Learning on the Base Model (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24290) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.24290))| Xiangyu Zhang, Qi Han, djiang, YinminZhang, reign12 | Open-Reasoner-Zero (ORZ) introduces an open-source, minimalist approach for large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) focused on enhancing reasoning in base language models. The primary objective was to determine if vanilla PPO with simple rule-based rewards and no KL regularization could scale LLM reasoning performance and response length effectively. The methodology involved applying PPO with GAE (λ=1, γ=1) and a binary correctness reward directly to Qwen2.5 base models (0.5B to 32B) using a curated reasoning dataset. Results showed that ORZ-32B surpassed the DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B model on benchmarks like MATH500 (92.2 vs 91.6) and GPQA Diamond (55.5 vs 55.0) using only 1/10th the training steps, demonstrating stable scaling without KL constraints. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that complex RLHF setups with KL regularization may not be necessary for scaling reasoning; a simpler, resource-efficient PPO configuration can yield strong results directly on base models. |

The research objective is to achieve precise spatial layout and motion control in video synthesis and editing using temporally sparse user-drawn sketches. It utilizes a skip-residual sketch control structure for DiT models, an inter-frame attention mechanism for propagating sparse conditions, and a video insertion module with latent fusion for editing. Experiments show superior performance, with SketchVideo achieving the lowest LPIPS (27.56) and highest CLIP score (98.31) in generation benchmarks compared to methods like SparseCtrl. AI practitioners can implement this technique to provide users with fine-grained geometric and motion control in video creation/editing tools, enhancing controllability beyond text-only approaches. |
| TeleAntiFraud-28k: A Audio-Text Slow-Thinking Dataset for Telecom Fraud
  Detection (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24115) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.24115))| Kai Wu, Jingpeng Wang, HuangMinhua, WDong, JimmyMa99 | This paper introduces TeleAntiFraud-28k, an open-source audio-text dataset with slow-thinking annotations for telecom fraud detection. The research aims to overcome the lack of suitable multimodal training data by integrating audio signals with reasoning-oriented textual analysis for automated fraud identification. Methodology involves dataset construction via three strategies: processing real anonymized calls with ASR/TTS, semantic expansion using LLM self-instruction, and multi-agent adversarial simulation, followed by LLM-based annotation capturing reasoning steps. Key results include the creation of 28,511 audio-text pairs and the demonstration that fine-tuning Qwen2Audio on this dataset significantly boosted fraud detection F1 score to 84.78% (average F1 across tasks 83.00%) on the established TeleAntiFraud-Bench. For AI practitioners, this work provides a crucial dataset and benchmark for developing and evaluating multimodal, reasoning-capable audio language models specifically for the challenging task of telecom fraud detection. |
| Efficient Inference for Large Reasoning Models: A Survey (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23077) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.23077))| jiaheng233, Bibaolong, HongyuChen, HongchengGao, yueliu1999 | This survey reviews and categorizes methods for improving the inference token efficiency of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) while maintaining reasoning quality. The primary objective is to analyze techniques mitigating high token consumption, memory overhead, and inference time inherent in LRM's deliberative reasoning processes. It introduces a taxonomy classifying approaches into explicit compact Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which reduces tokens while keeping explicit structure, and implicit latent CoT, which encodes reasoning in hidden representations, alongside empirical analysis. Key findings categorize methods based on whether they maintain explicit reasoning steps or encode them latently; for instance, on GSM8K, explicit methods like TokenSkip (ratio=0.5) achieve 86.70% accuracy using 113.05 tokens with LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, while implicit methods like SoftCoT reach 85.81% accuracy with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, though its specific token cost comparison is not fully detailed in the provided table excerpt. AI practitioners gain insights into the performance/efficiency trade-offs of LRM optimization techniques, informing the selection of methods (e.g., explicit CoT for interpretability, implicit CoT for token reduction) for developing cost-effective reasoning applications. |
| Classical Planning with LLM-Generated Heuristics: Challenging the State
  of the Art with Python Code (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18809) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.18809))| jendrikseipp, andregrahl, abcorrea | This paper demonstrates using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate domain-dependent heuristic functions as Python code for classical planning tasks. The objective was to determine if LLM-generated heuristics could outperform traditional domain-independent heuristics and compete with state-of-the-art learned heuristics. The methodology involved prompting an LLM (e.g., DeepSeek R1) multiple times for a given planning domain, evaluating the resulting pool of Python heuristic functions on training tasks using Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS), and selecting the best-performing one. Results show the selected LLM-generated heuristics significantly outperformed the widely used hFF heuristic (solving 373 vs. 243 test tasks in Pyperplan) and were competitive with state-of-the-art learned heuristics implemented in optimized C++, even when run in an unoptimized Python planner. For AI practitioners, this implies LLMs can automate the creation of highly effective, domain-specific heuristics for planning, potentially accelerating development and improving performance without requiring deep heuristic engineering expertise or specialized learning pipelines. |
| Expanding RL with Verifiable Rewards Across Diverse Domains (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23829) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.23829))| zptu, haitaominlp, douvleplus, freesunshine0316, yudian | This paper extends Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to diverse domains like medicine and economics, using a distilled generative reward model. The main objective is to investigate RLVR's applicability beyond well-structured tasks and evaluate if a single, trained reward model can effectively provide cross-domain reward signals for free-form answers without domain-specific annotations. The methodology involves training a 7B parameter reward model using judgments distilled from a larger teacher LLM (Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct) and incorporating model-based soft scoring for RL fine-tuning (using REINFORCE, RLOO, etc.) of a base 7B policy model. Using RLOO with the distilled 7B reward model (RM-7B) and soft scoring yielded a 30.0% average accuracy on multi-subject tasks, outperforming the baseline rule-based reward (16.6%) and matching the performance using the much larger Qwen2.5-72B model directly for rewards (30.6%). For AI practitioners, this suggests that a smaller, distilled generative reward model can effectively guide RL fine-tuning across diverse domains with unstructured answers, offering a computationally efficient alternative to large teacher models or domain-specific reward engineering, enhancing RLVR's scalability and robustness. |
| Progressive Rendering Distillation: Adapting Stable Diffusion for
  Instant Text-to-Mesh Generation without 3D Data (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21694) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.21694))| Zhen Lei, Xiangyu Zhu, Rongyuan Wu, DarklordLeto, ZhiyuanthePony | This paper presents Progressive Rendering Distillation (PRD) to adapt Stable Diffusion (SD) for instant text-to-mesh generation without 3D ground-truth data. The objective is to overcome the 3D data scarcity problem by distilling knowledge from multi-view 2D diffusion models into an SD-based native 3D generator. PRD progressively denoises latent noise over a few steps, decoding intermediate results into Triplanes and using score distillation with SD, MVDream, and RichDreamer as teachers; Parameter-Efficient Triplane Adaptation (PETA) adds only 2.5% trainable parameters via LoRA. The resulting model, TriplaneTurbo, generates high-quality textured meshes in 1.2 seconds, achieving a CLIP Score of 68.2, outperforming prior methods in speed and quality without 3D training data. For AI practitioners, this work demonstrates an effective, data-efficient method to repurpose large 2D diffusion models for rapid 3D content creation, significantly reducing reliance on 3D datasets and accelerating generation pipelines. |
| TokenHSI: Unified Synthesis of Physical Human-Scene Interactions through
  Task Tokenization (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19901) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.19901))| BoDai, WenjiaWang, frankzydou, Zeshi209, lianganimation | TokenHSI introduces a unified transformer-based policy using task tokenization to synthesize diverse, physically plausible human-scene interactions. The primary objective is to develop a single, versatile physics-based controller capable of learning multiple foundational HSI skills and efficiently adapting them to novel, complex scenarios like skill composition or environment variations. Key methodology involves separate tokenizers for shared humanoid proprioception and distinct task states, combined within a transformer encoder via a masking mechanism, enabling multi-task learning and flexible adaptation by adding new tokenizers and lightweight adapter layers. Primary results demonstrate successful unification of diverse skills (following, sitting, climbing, carrying) and superior adaptation compared to baselines, achieving a 99.2% success rate on the challenging Climb + Carry skill composition task. For AI practitioners, this provides an efficient and extensible framework for building versatile physics-based agents capable of complex interactions, reducing the need for separate controllers per skill and enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks with minimal parameter fine-tuning. |
| KOFFVQA: An Objectively Evaluated Free-form VQA Benchmark for Large
  Vision-Language Models in the Korean Language (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23730) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.23730))| lastdefiance20, yoonshik1205 | This paper introduces KOFFVQA, a novel Korean free-form Visual Question Answering benchmark designed for objective evaluation of Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). The main objective is to overcome the limitations of existing VLM evaluation methods, namely the subjectivity of judge models and the lack of Korean-specific benchmarks, by providing a reliable framework for assessing open-ended VLM responses. The methodology involves a benchmark dataset of 275 curated image-question pairs, each accompanied by detailed, objective grading criteria, which guide an LLM judge (specifically Gemma 2 9B in testing) to score VLM responses on a scale of 0-10 across 10 performance categories. Results from evaluating 47 VLMs show this criteria-guided LLM-judge approach achieves significantly higher evaluation consistency (e.g., mean score standard deviation of 0.398 for Gemma 2 9B vs. 0.584 for ground-truth comparison) and accuracy (89.3% correct grading for Gemma 2 9B) compared to methods using ground-truth comparisons or VLM-as-a-judge, which was found prone to visual hallucinations. For AI practitioners, this work provides a robust benchmark and methodology for objectively evaluating the free-form reasoning and Korean language capabilities of VLMs, highlighting that explicit, objective criteria significantly improve judge model reliability over subjective or ground-truth-comparative approaches. |
| UPME: An Unsupervised Peer Review Framework for Multimodal Large
  Language Model Evaluation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14941) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.14941))| Zheyuan Liu, Yibing, yuehuang, MunanNing, 77Hui | This paper introduces UPME, an unsupervised peer review framework for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) using only image data, eliminating the need for human QA annotations. The research objective is to develop an objective MLLM evaluation method that avoids the high cost of human annotation and mitigates biases found in MLLM-as-a-judge systems. UPME utilizes a peer review process where MLLMs generate questions for images and evaluate peer answers using a vision-language scoring system (assessing correctness, visual understanding/reasoning, image-text correlation) refined by dynamic weight optimization based on evaluation consistency. Experimental results show UPME achieves high alignment with human judgments, attaining a Pearson correlation of 0.944 on the MMstar dataset, while significantly reducing verbosity and self-preference biases compared to baseline peer review methods. For AI practitioners, UPME offers a scalable, automated, and less biased approach to evaluate MLLM performance, particularly for visual capabilities, without requiring extensive human-annotated datasets. |
| Easi3R: Estimating Disentangled Motion from DUSt3R Without Training (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24391) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.24391))| Anpei Chen, Andreas Geiger, Yuliang Xiu, faneggg, rover-xingyu | Easi3R introduces a training-free method to adapt the static 3D reconstruction model DUSt3R for dynamic 4D reconstruction by disentangling motion from its attention maps. The main objective is to extract and separate camera and object motion information implicitly encoded within DUSt3R's attention layers without requiring retraining or fine-tuning on dynamic datasets. The key methodology involves aggregating spatial and temporal cross-attention maps to derive dynamic object segmentations, which are then used for attention re-weighting during a second inference pass and optional segmentation-aware global alignment. Easi3R significantly outperforms previous methods trained or fine-tuned on dynamic data across camera pose estimation, dynamic object segmentation (e.g., achieving 53.0 JM on DAVIS-all without SAM2 using the MonST3R backbone), and 4D point map reconstruction. For AI practitioners, this implies that task adaptation of large pre-trained models can sometimes be achieved through careful analysis and manipulation of internal representations like attention maps during inference, reducing the need for costly retraining on specialized dynamic datasets. |

  Flow-based DiTs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23022) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.23022))| Xiaoshui Huang, Zexiang Liu, Di Huang, Junyi Chen, Xianglong He | MeshCraft introduces a novel framework for efficient and controllable 3D mesh generation using flow-based diffusion transformers. The paper addresses the challenge of slow generation speeds and uncontrollable face numbers in existing mesh generation techniques. MeshCraft employs a transformer-based VAE to encode and decode meshes in a continuous latent space and a flow-based diffusion transformer conditioned on the number of faces. Experiments demonstrate MeshCraft achieves a 35x speed increase compared to MeshGPT while maintaining state-of-the-art mesh quality. The framework's efficient and controllable mesh generation capability enables AI practitioners to rapidly generate high-quality 3D assets with user-defined specifications.  |

Its objective is to reduce latency and computational costs in domain-specific, low-resource settings by optimizing the LLM's vocabulary. The methodology involves replacing low-frequency general tokens with high-frequency domain-specific n-gram tokens based on a token-saving score, initializing new embeddings using exponential weighting, and performing lightweight fine-tuning on embedding and adjacent layers. Results across two 7B LLMs and three niche domains show over a 25% reduction in token usage for both input processing and output generation, without compromising generation quality or end-task performance. For AI practitioners, this offers a resource-efficient technique to improve the inference speed and reduce the operational cost of LLMs deployed for specialized applications, particularly in settings with limited data or computational budgets. |

  Sequential Recommendation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22675) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.22675))| Xu Chen, Jun Xu, TengShi, KID-22, TangJiakai5704 | This paper introduces ReaRec, an inference-time framework that enhances sequential recommendation (SeqRec) models by incorporating multi-step implicit reasoning. The objective is to overcome the limitations of traditional direct forward inference in capturing complex user preference dynamics, especially for long-tail items. ReaRec achieves this by autoregressively feeding the last hidden state back into the SeqRec model, using specialized reasoning position embeddings, and employs two learning strategies: Ensemble Reasoning Learning (ERL) and Progressive Reasoning Learning (PRL).

The research aims to define and improve the perceptual accuracy of lip movements in speech-driven 3D talking heads, focusing on Temporal Synchronization, Lip Readability, and Expressiveness. A speech-mesh synchronized representation is developed using a two-stage training process, leveraging large-scale 2D audio-visual data before aligning with 3D mesh data, and is applied as a perceptual loss and metric (PLRS), alongside two new physical metrics (MTM for synchronization, SLCC for expressiveness). Experiments show that incorporating the proposed perceptual loss significantly improves existing models across all three criteria; for instance, applying it to FaceFormer on the VOCASET dataset improved the Perceptual Lip Readability Score (PLRS) from 0.368 to 0.463. AI practitioners can utilize the proposed perceptual loss to enhance the realism of 3D talking heads and employ the introduced metrics (MTM, PLRS, SLCC) for a more comprehensive, perceptually-grounded evaluation beyond traditional geometric error metrics like LVE. |

  via dynamic reinforcement learning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16081) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.16081))| Changwang Zhang, Feng Liu, Yuting Zhang, Zhiyuan Liu, jwanglux | OThink-MR1 introduces GRPO-D, a dynamic reinforcement learning strategy, to enhance the generalized multimodal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs beyond standard fine-tuning. The primary objective is to overcome the limitations of SFT and static RL by developing a dynamic RL approach (GRPO-D) that fosters better same-task performance and cross-task generalization for multimodal reasoning. The key methodology is GRPO-D, which employs a dynamically adjusted Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence weight during reinforcement learning fine-tuning to optimally balance policy exploration and exploitation based on verifiable multimodal task rewards. GRPO-D demonstrated superior same-task and cross-task performance, achieving over a 61.63% relative improvement versus SFT in cross-task generalization evaluations where SFT showed poor transferability. For AI practitioners, GRPO-D provides a superior fine-tuning technique for MLLMs, enabling the development of models with stronger, transferable reasoning abilities across diverse multimodal tasks without requiring retraining for each specific task. |
| Your ViT is Secretly an Image Segmentation Model (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19108) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.19108))| Giuseppe Averta, Narges Norouzi, Alexander Hermans, Niccolò Cavagnero, Tommie Kerssies | This paper introduces the Encoder-only Mask Transformer (EoMT), demonstrating that a plain Vision Transformer (ViT) can perform image segmentation without task-specific components like adapters or decoders. The study investigates if these components are essential for state-of-the-art ViT-based segmentation, hypothesizing their relevance diminishes with larger models and extensive pre-training. By systematically removing components from a ViT-Adapter + Mask2Former baseline and repurposing the ViT encoder blocks to process learnable queries alongside patch tokens, supplemented by a mask annealing strategy for efficient inference, EoMT is developed. Results show that EoMT with ViT-L achieves comparable Panoptic Quality (56.0 PQ) to the baseline (57.1 PQ) on COCO while being 4.4x faster (128 FPS vs 29 FPS). For AI practitioners, this implies that investing compute in scaling ViT models and pre-training, rather than adding architectural complexity, can yield simpler, faster, and highly accurate segmentation models that readily benefit from foundation model advancements. |
| 4D-Bench: Benchmarking Multi-modal Large Language Models for 4D Object
  Understanding (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17827) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.17827))| mhelhoseiny, ajhamdi, TonNew, bing-li-ai, vxuanz | This paper introduces 4D-Bench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in understanding dynamic 4D objects through question answering and captioning tasks. The objective is to assess current MLLM performance in multi-view spatial-temporal reasoning for 4D assets, addressing the lack of standardized evaluation in this domain. The methodology involved creating a dataset from rendered dynamic 3D objects (Objaverse-XL) into multi-view videos, curating data via motion and quality filters, and generating challenging QA pairs and human-annotated captions, followed by evaluating multiple MLLMs using accuracy and diverse captioning metrics, including GPT-4o assessment. Key results show MLLMs significantly underperform humans, with the state-of-the-art GPT-4o achieving only 62.98% overall accuracy on the 4D object QA task compared to a 91.08% human baseline, demonstrating particular weakness in object counting (37.29% average accuracy) and temporal reasoning. For AI practitioners, this highlights substantial MLLM limitations in integrating complex spatial-temporal information for 4D objects and handling counterfactual data, indicating a need for developing more robust models for applications involving dynamic 3D assets. |
| A Refined Analysis of Massive Activations in LLMs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22329) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.22329))| Fabian Güra, akanyaani, nilabhra, louisowen6 | This paper analyzes massive activations across diverse LLMs, challenging prior assumptions and evaluating mitigation strategies. The research objective is to systematically assess the characteristics, impact, and mitigation of massive activations across a broader range of GLU and non-GLU based LLM architectures than previously studied. Methodology involves intervention analysis (setting activations to zero/mean) on pre-trained models and retraining LLaMA-1B/GPT-2 with mitigation techniques (Attention KV Bias, TVR, DyT, hybrids), evaluating perplexity and downstream task performance. Primary results contradict prior claims, showing not all massive activations are detrimental, Attention KV bias mitigation is ineffective for architectures like LLaMA-1B, and hybrid strategies such as TVR + KV Bias successfully mitigate activations in LLaMA-1B (mean downstream task accuracy 52.0 vs 50.3 baseline) while preserving performance. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that mitigating massive activations, crucial for quantization and numerical stability, requires architecture-specific analysis and potentially hybrid approaches like TVR+KV Bias or TVR+DyT, as universal solutions are ineffective. |

The primary objective is to create high-fidelity 3D meshes (up to 1024³) with complex geometries, open surfaces, and interiors directly from rendering supervision, overcoming limitations of existing methods. Key methodologies involve adapting Flexicubes within a sparse voxel structure and employing a novel frustum-aware sectional voxel training strategy that activates only relevant voxels during rendering to drastically reduce memory consumption. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy, evidenced by an ~82% reduction in Chamfer Distance and an ~88% increase in F-score compared to previous methods on tested benchmarks.

The primary objective is to enhance diagnostic reliability and explainability compared to standard MLLMs by strictly adhering to retrieved clinical criteria and enabling quantitative analysis. The methodology utilizes a hierarchical agentic workflow: a task-level planner uses RAG to generate diagnostic plans based on medical knowledge, while case-level tool agents (specialized vision/VQA models, coding agent) execute steps on patient data, followed by a decider agent integrating findings. MedAgent-Pro significantly outperformed baselines, achieving 90.4% mACC on Glaucoma diagnosis using its MOE decider, a 32.3% absolute improvement over the best single foundation model tested (BioMedClip). For AI practitioners, this work implies that augmenting MLLMs with structured agentic workflows, external specialized tools, and explicit knowledge retrieval is crucial for building reliable and interpretable systems in domains requiring rigorous, evidence-based quantitative reasoning like medical diagnosis. |

The objective is to reconstruct 4D CT volumes at arbitrary time points directly from projections, eliminating discrete phase binning and the need for external respiratory gating devices. The methodology integrates dynamic radiative Gaussian splatting, modeled via a spatiotemporal encoder-decoder for continuous deformation prediction, with a self-supervised, physiology-driven periodic consistency loss to learn respiratory cycles directly from projection data. Results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 9.93 dB PSNR improvement over traditional methods and a 2.25 dB gain over prior Gaussian splatting approaches on the DIR dataset. For AI practitioners, this provides a hardware-free method for high-fidelity, continuous dynamic medical image reconstruction, potentially enhancing motion analysis in clinical applications like image-guided radiotherapy. |
| On Large Multimodal Models as Open-World Image Classifiers (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21851) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.21851))| Yiming Wang, Enrico Fini, paolorota, massimilianom, altndrr | This paper evaluates Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for open-world image classification beyond predefined categories. The objective was to assess LMM performance in an unconstrained classification setting and analyze prediction errors using novel metrics. The methodology involved evaluating 13 LMMs on 10 benchmarks using four metrics (Text Inclusion, Llama Inclusion, Semantic Similarity, Concept Similarity) to measure alignment between generated text and ground truth labels. Results indicate LMMs outperform open-world contrastive baselines (e.g., CaSED) on inclusion metrics but significantly underperform closed-world models (e.g., CLIP), with notable errors in granularity (e.g., predicting "dog" instead of "pug") and fine-grained discrimination; for instance, even the best models struggled significantly on very fine-grained datasets, often achieving near 0% Text Inclusion. AI practitioners should recognize current LMMs' limitations in specific open-world classification, noting that while promising, tailored prompting and reasoning only partially alleviate errors related to granularity and fine-grained distinctions compared to traditional closed-world approaches. |

The main objective is to estimate SKEL parameters directly from an image, overcoming the lack of paired image-SKEL training data. HSMR utilizes a transformer network trained with iteratively refined pseudo-ground truth SKEL parameters generated by converting existing SMPL datasets and optimizing against 2D keypoints ("SKELify"). HSMR achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks compared to SMPL-based methods like HMR2.0, while significantly outperforming them (by >10mm PA-MPJPE) on datasets with extreme poses like MOYO and reducing unnatural joint rotations. For AI practitioners, this offers a way to generate more physically plausible 3D human models directly from images, which is crucial for biomechanics, robotics, and simulation applications where joint limits and skeletal accuracy are paramount. |

  Inspiration-Based Task Decomposition (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21248) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.21248))| yuqiangli, bgao22182, jinjieni, ZonglinY, yujieliu | ResearchBench introduces a benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in scientific discovery by decomposing the process into inspiration retrieval, hypothesis composition, and ranking. The objective is to assess LLM performance on these fundamental sub-tasks using recent, contamination-resistant scientific literature across 12 disciplines. An automated LLM-based agentic framework extracts research components (questions, background, inspirations, hypotheses) from 1386 papers published in 2024, forming the basis for evaluation, including carefully selected negative examples for retrieval tasks. Results show LLMs excel at the out-of-distribution inspiration retrieval task (GPT-4o hit ratio: 45.65% for top 4% candidates), while hypothesis composition and ranking show moderate capabilities with potential for improvement; ranking is notably affected by position bias. For AI practitioners, this indicates LLMs can serve as "research hypothesis mines" capable of surfacing novel knowledge associations for automated discovery, though the bottleneck in retrieval suggests a reliance on pretraining depth over post-training refinement. |
| Optimal Stepsize for Diffusion Sampling (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21774) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.21774))| Han Hu, Jianning Pei, cientgu | This paper introduces Optimal Stepsize Distillation (OSS), a dynamic programming framework to derive theoretically optimal stepsize schedules for accelerating diffusion model sampling. The objective is to overcome suboptimal discretization in diffusion sampling by focusing on principled stepsize schedule design, rather than solely optimizing update directions. OSS treats stepsize optimization as knowledge distillation, using dynamic programming to recursively minimize the global discretization error between a few-step student sampler and a many-step teacher reference trajectory. Experiments demonstrate that OSS enables significant acceleration, achieving 10x speedup for text-to-image generation while maintaining 99.4% of the teacher model's performance on the GenEval benchmark.

| Exploring the Evolution of Physics Cognition in Video Generation: A
  Survey (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21765) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.21765))| huangsiteng, wangcunxiang, huangsiteng, yishanwang, minnielin | This survey reviews the integration of physical cognition into video generation models, organizing advancements along an evolutionary path inspired by human cognitive development. The main objective is to systematically categorize methods for improving physical fidelity in generated videos, addressing the gap between visual realism and physical plausibility. The paper proposes a three-tier taxonomy (Basic Schematic Perception, Passive Cognition, Active Cognition) to classify techniques like motion-guided generation, physics-inspired regularization, simulation integration, and LLM-based reasoning. Despite progress, the survey highlights that even state-of-the-art models often violate fundamental physical laws, generating visually appealing but physically inconsistent results, as evidenced by evaluations on benchmarks like PhyGenBench [86] and Physics-IQ [84]. For AI practitioners, this implies that achieving physically plausible video generation, essential for applications like robotics and simulation, requires moving beyond visual mimicry towards integrating explicit physical knowledge and interaction mechanisms. |

The objective was to investigate whether synthetic videos, generated with physical consistency using computer graphics, can enhance the physical realism (e.g., 3D consistency, human pose integrity) of diffusion-based video generation models. The methodology involved generating synthetic videos using Blender/Unreal Engine, curating this data based on factors like asset/rendering quality and camera setups, employing a specific captioning strategy, and introducing a training technique called `SimDrop` to integrate synthetic data while mitigating visual artifacts using a reference model and classifier-free guidance. Primary results show significant improvement in physical fidelity across tasks like large human motion, camera rotation, and layer decomposition; for instance, on the camera spin shot task, the synthetically-enhanced model achieved an 80% success rate in user studies compared to 20% for the baseline and reduced the 3D reconstruction re-projection error (`ê_proj`) from 0.437 to 0.135. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that leveraging carefully curated synthetic video data, combined with techniques like `SimDrop`, offers a data-centric approach to enhance the physical consistency and reduce artifacts in video generation models without requiring modifications to the core model architecture. |

The objective was to effectively erase sensitive content by balancing the trade-off between over-forgetting general knowledge and under-forgetting targeted data. Their methodology involved training two distinct LoRA models using Negative Preference Optimization (NPO), Gradient Descent on Retain set (GDR), and KL divergence minimization (KLR) to induce complementary biases, then merging them using TIES-Merging. The merged system ranked second online (Task Aggregate 0.944) and locally achieved an Aggregate Score of 0.806 and a near-optimal MIA AUC of 0.501, significantly outperforming the individual biased models. For AI practitioners, this demonstrates model merging as a practical technique to combine models with opposing unlearning biases for more effective and balanced sensitive data removal, though limitations in current evaluation metrics are noted. |

The objective is to explore discrete diffusion models as an alternative unified generative formulation for joint text and image domains, comparing their advantages over autoregressive (AR) models. UniDisc employs a transformer architecture trained using a discrete diffusion process involving masking tokens (text and image) with an absorbing state and learning to denoise via a weighted cross-entropy objective. Results show UniDisc outperforms AR models in conditional generation using classifier-free guidance (CFG), enables zero-shot joint text-image inpainting, and demonstrates superior joint retrieval accuracy (e.g., 0.64 vs 0.17 on DataComp1B). For AI practitioners, UniDisc offers enhanced controllability, editability, and a flexible inference time vs. quality trade-off for multimodal generation tasks compared to traditional AR approaches, although scaling analysis indicates it requires approximately 13.2x more training compute for equivalent loss levels. |

The primary research objective is to empirically evaluate how effectively three open-source generative LLMs (LLaMA, Qwen, Qwen-Coder) can extract these inputs compared to a fine-tuned BERT model. Using a dataset of 206 annotated Linux coreutils bug reports and a one-shot prompting strategy, the study evaluates extraction accuracy against human annotations using BLEU scores. The generative LLMs significantly outperformed the BERT baseline, with Qwen yielding the best results, achieving a BLEU-2 score of ≥ 0.5 for 62.62% of its extracted commands. For AI practitioners, this indicates that generative LLMs offer considerable potential for automating the extraction of executable commands from bug reports, aiding debugging workflows, though challenges in handling command variations and extraction failures persist. |

| Unconditional Priors Matter! Improving Conditional Generation of
  Fine-Tuned Diffusion Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20240) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.20240))| Jaihoon Kim, Minhyuk, phillipinseoul, prinphunya | This paper introduces a training-free method to enhance conditional generation from fine-tuned diffusion models by utilizing stronger unconditional priors from base models. The primary objective is to address the degradation in conditional generation quality caused by poor unconditional noise predictions learned during Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) based fine-tuning. The key methodology involves replacing the unconditional noise prediction term in the CFG sampling process of the fine-tuned model with the corresponding prediction from its original base model or another pretrained model with robust unconditional generation capabilities.

| ViLBench: A Suite for Vision-Language Process Reward Modeling (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20271) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.20271))| cihangxie, xianft, alihiker, Helicopt, PahaII | This paper introduces VILBENCH, a benchmark suite for vision-language process reward modeling, alongside a new dataset (ViLReward-73K) and a trained process reward model (ViLPRM). The main objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of vision-language large models (VLLMs) as process reward models (PRMs) and output reward models (ORMs), and to develop improved PRMs for tasks requiring step-wise reasoning. Key methodologies include benchmarking seven VLLMs on five VL datasets, filtering data to create VILBENCH emphasizing step-wise rewards, collecting preference data using an enhanced MCTS algorithm, and training a 3B parameter ViLPRM based on QwenVL-2.5. Primary results show neither ORM nor PRM consistently outperforms the other across tasks using general VLLMs, while the trained ViLPRM achieves an average improvement of 3.3% over standard Chain-of-Thought evaluation on VILBENCH. For AI practitioners, this indicates that specialized PRMs trained on process supervision data, like ViLPRM, can better evaluate complex vision-language reasoning steps than general VLLMs or ORMs, highlighting a pathway to improve model alignment and evaluation for multi-step multimodal tasks. |

  Systems (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20756) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.20756))| xzwnlp, bozhong, xiangchen-dvi, JizhanFang, Chenxiwang | This paper introduces ADS-Edit, a multimodal benchmark dataset for evaluating knowledge editing techniques applied to Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). The research objective is to assess how effectively knowledge editing can update LMMs with domain-specific ADS knowledge (addressing traffic knowledge gaps, complex conditions, dynamic states) without requiring full retraining. The methodology involves constructing the ADS-Edit benchmark from existing ADS datasets (LingoQA, DriveLM, CODA-LM) with video, multi-view, and single-image data across perception, understanding, and decision-making scenarios, and evaluating four editing baselines (Prompt, AdaLora, GRACE, WISE) on reliability, generality, and locality. Primary results demonstrate that memory-based methods achieve high reliability (e.g., GRACE reached 100% reliability on single edits), but differ significantly in generality (GRACE <30%, WISE ~85-95%), with WISE showing strong locality (~100%). For AI practitioners, ADS-Edit provides a framework to evaluate and select knowledge editing methods for efficiently updating LMMs in ADS, indicating WISE offers a balanced trade-off for update reliability, generalization, and parameter preservation. |

  Autoregressive Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20198) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.20198))| Min Li, Lijuan, zyang39, linjieli222, Awiny | This paper presents LongTextAR, a multimodal autoregressive model enabling high-fidelity long-text image generation. It addresses the challenge of accurately rendering extensive textual content in images, a limitation of current generative models. The methodology identifies Vector Quantization (VQ) tokenization bottlenecks and introduces TextBinarizer, a novel text-focused binary tokenizer, integrated into a Llama2-based autoregressive architecture trained on text-rich data. LongTextAR significantly outperforms models like SD3.5 Large, achieving 69.5% OCR accuracy on long texts (>10 words) versus 52.3% for SD3.5 Large, and offers controllable text rendering (font, size, color, alignment). For AI practitioners, this work demonstrates that specialized tokenization within an autoregressive framework provides a strong alternative to diffusion models for generating images requiring accurate, controllable long text, impacting applications like automated document and presentation creation. |
| Attention IoU: Examining Biases in CelebA using Attention Maps (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19846) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.19846))| Vikram V. Ramaswamy, Olga Russakovsky, tyleryzhu, serianni | This paper introduces Attention-IoU, a metric using attention maps to quantify biases within computer vision classification models by analyzing internal representations. The objective is to identify spurious correlations and understand how specific image features contribute to biased predictions, moving beyond performance disparities. The core methodology uses a generalized Intersection-over-Union (Attention-IoU) to compare GradCAM attention maps against ground-truth feature masks (mask score) or other attribute attention maps (heatmap score). Validation on Waterbirds shows the mask score accurately tracks induced bias (decreasing from 0.72±0.02 to 0.42±0.03 as bias increases from 50% to 100%), and analysis on CelebA reveals Attention-IoU uncovers correlations like that between `Blond_Hair` and `Male` (heatmap score 0.72±0.02) potentially linked to unlabeled confounders, unlike `Wavy_Hair` (0.65±0.03). For AI practitioners, Attention-IoU provides a tool to pinpoint spatial sources of bias within models, indicating that biases can stem from internal representations not solely reflected in dataset label correlations, thus informing more targeted debiasing interventions. |

The research aims to develop an efficient offline knowledge distillation strategy for LLM pre-training that requires storing only a sparse subset of teacher logits without compromising student model performance or calibration. The key methodology involves using importance sampling (specifically, sampling proportional to teacher probabilities) to create unbiased sparse target distributions, theoretically and empirically contrasting this with biased Top-K sampling approaches. Primary results show that RS-KD achieves performance comparable to full distillation using only 12 unique sampled tokens, maintains near-perfect calibration (ECE ~0.8%), preserves expected gradients (4° angular difference vs. FullKD), and offers significant training throughput gains (1.7x-2.6x faster than FullKD). For AI practitioners, RS-KD offers a computationally efficient method to pre-train smaller LLMs via offline distillation, drastically reducing the storage required for teacher logits (using ~0.01%) and accelerating training with marginal overhead compared to standard cross-entropy training. |
| DINeMo: Learning Neural Mesh Models with no 3D Annotations (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20220) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.20220))| Alan Yuille, Weijie Guo, wufeim, guofeng1123 | DINeMo presents a neural mesh model for category-level 3D pose estimation trained without 3D annotations. The main objective is to overcome the limitation of requiring extensive 3D annotations for training neural mesh models, enabling broader applicability and scalability. The key methodology involves leveraging pseudo-correspondence derived from large visual foundation models (SD-DINO) via a novel bidirectional generation process that integrates local features and global context, combined with Grounded-SAM for enhanced inference. DINeMo significantly outperforms previous zero- and few-shot methods on PASCAL3D+ car pose estimation (e.g., narrowing the gap with fully-supervised methods by 67.3% on Acc@pi/18, LO) and demonstrates effective scaling with additional unlabeled training data. For AI practitioners, this work offers a viable pathway to develop robust 3D object understanding models without relying on difficult-to-obtain 3D ground truth, utilizing unlabeled image data for training. |
| Image as an IMU: Estimating Camera Motion from a Single Motion-Blurred
  Image (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17358) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.17358))| r0nn13, jerredchen | This paper introduces a method to estimate instantaneous camera rotational (ω) and translational (v) velocity directly from motion blur within a single image. The objective is to leverage motion blur, often considered an artifact, as the primary source of information for robust ego-motion estimation during fast camera movements, eliminating the need for IMUs or multi-frame analysis. The approach first predicts dense motion flow and monocular depth using a neural network, then recovers velocity by solving a differentiable linear least squares system derived from motion field equations, enabling end-to-end training on synthetic and real data. Evaluated on real-world data, the method yields state-of-the-art velocity estimates (e.g., average rotational RMSE 1.22/0.91/1.76 rad/s), significantly outperforming MASt3R and COLMAP, and achieves real-time performance (30 FPS). AI practitioners can apply this technique for real-time, drift-free, IMU-like velocity measurements in high-motion scenarios (e.g., robotics, AR/VR) using only a single blurred camera image, enhancing robustness where traditional VO/SLAM methods fail. |

  Pathological Images (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17970) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.17970))| Rundong Xue, Jiaxuan Xiao, Jun Liu, Shiru Wang, Yang Luo | PathoHR is a novel pipeline for breast cancer survival prediction using enhanced high-resolution pathological image features and optimized similarity learning. The main objective is to improve survival prediction accuracy by effectively extracting representative features from high-resolution WSIs while managing computational costs and addressing tumor heterogeneity. The methodology involves patch-wise feature extraction using a pre-trained encoder, integrating a plug-and-play high-resolution Vision Transformer (ViTAR) for feature enhancement, and systematically evaluating various similarity metrics (e.g., Cosine, Euclidean, Attention Score) for adaptive token merging. Results demonstrate that using enhanced 16x16 patches with the PathoHR pipeline (specifically with cosine similarity) achieves superior performance (AUC 0.90741) compared to baseline methods using larger raw 24x24 patches (AUC 0.8), validating the approach's effectiveness and efficiency. For AI practitioners, this implies that integrating resolution enhancement techniques (like high-res ViTs) with optimized similarity-based feature learning can enable more accurate analysis of large medical images using smaller patches, reducing computational overhead without sacrificing predictive power. |

Key methodology involves constructing the 6K-question HAVEN benchmark and proposing a thinking-based mitigation approach combining supervised reasoning fine-tuning (SRFT) and thinking-based direct preference optimization (TDPO). Primary results show significant variation in hallucination across 16 LMMs, with the proposed SRFT+TDPO method improving baseline accuracy by 7.65% on hallucination evaluation and reducing the consistency bias score by 4.5%. For AI practitioners, HAVEN offers a standardized tool to assess video LMM reliability regarding hallucinations, while the SRFT+TDPO training strategy presents a method to enhance model factuality and reasoning in video tasks. |

  Rollover Budget Forcing (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19385) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.19385))| Minhyuk Sung, Jisung Hwang, Taehoon Yoon, Jaihoon Kim | This paper introduces an inference-time scaling approach for pretrained flow models using stochastic generation and adaptive compute allocation to enhance alignment with user preferences. The main objective is to enable effective inference-time scaling, similar to diffusion models, for deterministic flow models without retraining. The key methodology involves converting the flow model's ODE to an SDE, using a Variance Preserving (VP) interpolant instead of a linear one to increase diversity, and applying Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF) to adaptively allocate computation across timesteps. Results show the VP-SDE with RBF significantly improves compositional alignment, achieving a VQAScore of 0.925, outperforming the base model (0.726) and diffusion models even with fewer computations (NFEs). For AI practitioners, this method allows enhancing existing flow models to better follow complex prompts (e.g., counting, spatial relations) during inference, offering a computationally efficient way to improve output quality and alignment compared to standard generation or diffusion model scaling approaches. |

The objective is to overcome limitations like manifold deviation (latent upsampling) and smoothness (RGB upsampling) in reference-based high-resolution generation, enabling faster inference and better detail preservation beyond native model resolutions. The methodology involves training an LSR module to map low-resolution latents to the high-resolution manifold and using RNA to inject Canny edge-guided noise adaptively, enhancing high-frequency details without progressive upsampling. Integrating LSRNA into DemoFusion for 16x resolution (4096x4096) reduced generation time to 34% (1507s to 506s) and improved patch-FID from 32.89 to 29.12 compared to the baseline DemoFusion.

The primary objective is to enable LLMs to handle complex multi-hop questions requiring multiple retrieval steps by treating search operations as part of the reasoning chain. The key methodology involves using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), where the LLM generates text thoughts and search queries, receives retrieval results, and is optimized based solely on rewards derived from final answer correctness and format adherence. Experiments training Qwen2.5 models showed significant improvements over baselines on multi-hop QA benchmarks, with average absolute gains ranging from 8.9% to 22.4% across benchmarks, such as a 17.56% average LLM-as-a-judge improvement for the 7B model.

The primary objective is to mitigate the degradation of safety alignment caused by fine-tuning, particularly on benign data, without sacrificing downstream task performance. The key methodology involves modifying training data instructions by appending either the initial tokens of the ground-truth answer (Real Answer) or a fixed prefix phrase (Virtual Answer), thereby minimizing perturbations to the model's initial token distributions. Results show LookAhead Tuning (virtual) significantly improves safety metrics (e.g., +20.76% average Jailbreak Safe Rate) compared to vanilla fine-tuning, while maintaining comparable utility (-1.59% average decrease across tasks). For AI practitioners, this presents a simple, low-resource, data-centric method to fine-tune models more safely without requiring architectural changes or significant computational overhead. |

FDConv employs Fourier Disjoint Weight (FDW) to create diverse parallel weights from frequency-grouped spectral coefficients, Kernel Spatial Modulation (KSM) for fine-grained spatial filter adjustment, and Frequency Band Modulation (FBM) for spatially varying frequency response adaptation. Applied to ResNet-50 for object detection, FDConv achieves an Apbox of 39.4 on COCO with only +3.6M parameters, outperforming prior methods requiring substantially larger parameter increases (e.g., ODConv +65.1M for 39.2 Apbox). For AI practitioners, FDConv provides a parameter-efficient module to improve the adaptability and performance of vision models on dense prediction tasks by explicitly managing weight frequency diversity, integrating readily into existing ConvNet and Transformer architectures. |

The key methodology involves a dual-branch spatial attention mechanism in a T2V diffusion U-Net, integration of image inpainting models via an I2V mode, and a two-stage pipeline (keyframe plus in-between frame propagation) for long videos. In object insertion, the method achieved a mIOU of 85.00%, surpassing existing baselines. For AI practitioners, MTV-Inpaint offers a single framework capable of various video inpainting tasks and their derivates like multi-modal inpainting, editing and object removal with state-of-art performance, avoiding the needs of training specialized models.  |
| Error Analyses of Auto-Regressive Video Diffusion Models: A Unified
  Framework (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10704) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.10704))| duchao, TIanyupang, xiaolili, Fengzhuo, k-nick | This paper develops a theoretical framework for analyzing errors in auto-regressive video diffusion models (ARVDMs) and uses the analysis to propose architectural improvements. The main research question is what types of errors are shared by most ARVDMs, why do those errors appear, and how can they be mitigated. The key methodology involves developing a unified framework, Meta-ARVDM, analyzing the KL-divergence between generated and true videos to identify error sources, and deriving an information-theoretic impossibility result related to the error. A primary result is the identification of "error accumulation" and "memory bottleneck", with the KL-divergence bound including terms for noise initialization, score estimation, discretization errors, and a memory bottleneck term specifically I(Output; Past | Input). The principal implication is that AI practitioners can mitigate the memory bottleneck by modifying the network structure, such as using prepending and channel concatenation, leading to improved trade-offs between error and computational cost.  |

  BLV-aligned Dataset of Diagram Descriptions (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13369) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.13369))| Jaime-Choi, sangryul, namin0202, eunkey, soarhigh | SIGHTATION, a novel dataset, enhances diagram descriptions for blind and low-vision (BLV) users by incorporating sighted user feedback on Vision Language Model (VLM) outputs. The main research objective is to create a BLV-aligned dataset of diagram descriptions that addresses the misalignment between sighted annotators and BLV user preferences. The key methodology involves a two-pass VLM inference with latent supervision using a guide generated, followed by sighted-user assessments of the VLM-generated descriptions in terms of preference, completion, retrieval, and question answering. Primary results reveal that preference-tuning a 2B model on the dataset increased usefulness ratings by BLV educators by an average of 1.670 standard deviations. Principal implication for AI practitioners is that leveraging sighted user assessments of VLM-generated content, guided by a multi-pass inference, provides a scalable and effective method to develop datasets that meet the needs of BLV users.  |

| Basic Category Usage in Vision Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12530) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.12530))| KyleMoore, JesseTNRoberts, HTSawyer | Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit human-like basic-level categorization preferences, distinctions between biological/non-biological objects, and expert-level shifts. The main research question is whether basic-level categorization behaviors observed in humans transfer to large language models. The key methodology involved prompting two VLMs (Llama 3.2 Vision Instruct and Molmo 7B-D) with images and comparing model-generated descriptions to a dataset of basic-level image labels, using two-proportion Z-tests for statistical analysis. Primary results showed that Llama 3.2 produced basic-level categorizations in 60.2% of outputs, and both models used basic-level terms significantly less (p<0.01) for non-biological items. The principal implication is that understanding how LLMs represent object categories, mirroring human cognition, is essential for developing models that align more closely with human behavior and interpretability.  |
| Investigating Human-Aligned Large Language Model Uncertainty (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12528) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.12528))| Pamela Wisniewski, Daryl Watson, Kyle Moore, JesseTNRoberts | This work investigates how well various large language model (LLM) uncertainty measures correlate with human uncertainty. The main research question is what LLM uncertainty measures best align with human group-level uncertainty on non-factual questions. The methodology involves comparing LLM uncertainty on a curated dataset of survey questions against human response distributions, using measures like self-reporting, entropy, and ensemble methods. The primary result is that top-k entropy correlates negatively with human uncertainty and decreases in human-similarity with increased model size (r > 0.3 for many models), but combining multiple measures produces a generalizable model (r ≈ 0.5 for cross-validation and r>0.6 on full data) . AI practitioners can use mixtures of uncertainty quantification methods, and potentially combining methods such as nucleus size and top-k entropy, to create LLMs that better reflect human-like uncertainty, especially for applications requiring calibrated trust and human-AI collaboration.  |

The main research objective is to generate video-level captions with corresponding bounding boxes that consistently localize key noun phrases across the video frames. The key methodology includes an automatic annotation method that aggregates frame-level grounded captions into temporally consistent video annotations, coupled with a Grounded Video Caption Generation model (GROVE) that uses spatio-temporal adapters and a temporal objectness head. The primary results show that GROVE, pre-trained on the new, automatically-annotated HowToGround1M dataset (1M videos) and fine-tuned on the manually-annotated iGround dataset, achieves a CIDEr score of 85.4 on the iGround test set. The principal implication is that AI practitioners can leverage large-scale automatic annotation and pre-training, followed by fine-tuning on smaller, high-quality datasets, to achieve state-of-the-art results in grounded video caption generation.  |
| FlowTok: Flowing Seamlessly Across Text and Image Tokens (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10772) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.10772))| Liang-Chieh Chen, QHL067, QihangYu, turkeyju | FlowTok is a framework that enables direct flow matching between text and images by encoding both into compact 1D tokens. The main research question is whether multimodal understanding and generation can be unified by enabling direct transitions within a shared, compact 1D latent space. The key methodology involves projecting both text and images into a unified 1D latent space using an enhanced image tokenizer and a text projector, then applying flow matching. FlowTok reduces the latent space size by 3.3x compared to prior methods at 256 resolution and achieves a COCO FID-30K score of 9.67 while completing training in 26.1 8-A100 days.

| Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention: Is Learnable Attention Better For Vision
  Transformers? (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10632) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.10632))| Xin Li, Killian Hitsman, aritradutta, maitysubhajit | This paper investigates learnable attention mechanisms based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for Vision Transformers (ViTs). The main research question is whether a learnable multi-head self-attention (MHSA) module, specifically a Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KArAt), can improve the performance of vanilla ViTs. The key methodology involves designing a general KArAt, and a specific variant, Fourier-KArAt, and evaluating them against vanilla ViTs on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K datasets, analyzing loss landscapes, weight distributions, and attention maps. The primary result shows ViT-Tiny+Fourier KArAt outperforms ViT-Tiny on CIFAR-10 by 5.40% in Top-1 accuracy, but larger ViT models with KArAt show diminished gains or worse performance. The implication is that directly replacing softmax with learnable activations in ViT's attention mechanism does not guarantee improved performance, requiring careful design due to increased model complexity and optimization challenges, although in some instances, smaller models can improve their performance.  |

  Detailed Video Caption (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09279) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.09279))| Hao Li, Zhiyu Tan, xiaomengyang, Kobeshegu, Fr0zencr4nE | Cockatiel-13B is a video captioning model that ensembles synthetic and human-aligned training to generate detailed and human-preferred video descriptions. The main research objective is to address the imbalanced video-caption alignment and misalignment with human preferences in existing video detailed captioning (VDC) models. The key methodology involves a three-stage training pipeline that curates data using a human-aligned caption quality scorer, trains a 13B parameter model (Cockatiel-13B) on the curated data, and distills an 8B parameter model (Cockatiel-8B) from it. Primary results show Cockatiel-13B achieving a new state-of-the-art VDCSCORE average of 43.80, outperforming existing models. The principal implication is that AI practitioners can achieve more human-aligned and dimension-balanced video descriptions by utilizing a training procedure that selectively combines diverse model strengths, guided by structured human preferences.  |

The main research objective is to develop an autoregressive visual generation method that improves efficiency and preserves spatial/temporal locality, unlike raster-order "next-token prediction" approaches. The key methodology is a near-to-far "next-neighbor prediction" mechanism, using dimension-oriented decoding heads to predict multiple adjacent tokens in parallel along orthogonal dimensions. Results show that on ImageNet 256x256, NAR-L achieves a lower FID (3.06) than LlamaGen-XXL (3.09) with 87.8% fewer steps and 13.8x higher throughput. AI practitioners can use NAR to achieve more efficient autoregressive visual generation with improved fidelity compared to traditional next-token prediction and existing parallel approaches, particularly beneficial for high-resolution image and video tasks.  |

  with Interleaved Multimodal Generation via Asymmetric Synergy (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06542) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.06542))| Zizhen Li, Fanrui Zhang, Chuanhao Li, Yukang Feng, Jianwen Sun | ARMOR v0.1 is a resource-efficient framework that upgrades existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to unified models (UniMs) capable of both understanding and interleaved text-image generation. The main research objective is to enable MLLMs to perform multimodal generation while preserving their understanding capabilities and minimizing computational overhead. The key methodology involves an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture with a forward-switching mechanism, a curated interleaved dataset, and a three-stage "What or How to Generate" (WoHG) training algorithm. Experimental results show that ARMOR outperforms existing UniMs on multimodal understanding benchmarks (78.8 score on MMB versus 62.6 for Janus-pro) while achieving comparable generation performance. AI practitioners can leverage ARMOR to build UniMs by fine-tuning existing MLLMs, thereby reducing training costs and enabling natural text-image interleaved generation.  |

The main research objective is to determine if 3D tasks can be solved directly by a neural network without visual geometry post-processing. The key methodology is a large transformer with alternating frame-wise and global self-attention, trained on multiple 3D-annotated datasets to predict camera parameters, depth maps, point maps, and 3D point tracks. The primary results show that VGGT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RealEstate10K and CO3Dv2 datasets for camera pose estimation (AUC@30 of 93.5 and 91.8 respectively, with BA), and also achieves superior accuracy on the DTU and ETH3D datasets for multi-view depth and point map estimation, exceeding optimization-based and other feed-forward methods. Principal implication is that AI practitioners can leverage VGGT for fast and accurate 3D reconstruction, reducing or eliminating the reliance on costly iterative optimization techniques commonly used in computer vision, potentially simplifying and accelerating 3D vision pipelines.  |
| From TOWER to SPIRE: Adding the Speech Modality to a Text-Only LLM (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10620) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.10620))| Tsz Kin Lam, Anil Keshwani, Sonal Sannigrahi, Kshitij Ambilduke, bpop | SPIRE extends the TOWER language model to process speech by incorporating discretized speech units and continued pre-training. The main research objective is to integrate English speech processing (transcription and translation) into an existing text-only multilingual LLM, TOWER, while maintaining its original text-task performance. The methodology involves two stages: continued pre-training (CPT) on a mixture of ASR data and TOWER's text data, and instruction tuning (IT) on MT, ASR, and ST datasets, employing HuBERT-based k-means clustering for speech discretization. SPIREFULL achieves a Word Error Rate (WER) of 4.2 on the LibriSpeech test-clean set, outperforming models like Spirit-LM and the Whisper-base, though not matching the performance of more heavily speech-trained models. AI practitioners can adapt a text-based LLM for speech tasks with preserved performance on text-based tasks by leveraging the recipe of speech discretization and CPT+IT.  |
| Group-robust Machine Unlearning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09330) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.09330))| Massimiliano Mancini, Elisa Ricci, Stéphane Lathuilière, Subhankar Roy, Thomas De Min | This paper introduces group-robust machine unlearning to address performance degradation in specific demographic groups caused by non-uniformly distributed data removal requests. The main research question is how to unlearn data from a trained model while preserving performance for groups that are over-represented in the forget set. The key methodology involves sample distribution reweighting during retraining and a novel approximate unlearning method (MIU) that minimizes mutual information between model features and group information, alongside mutual information calibration with original model. Primary results show that MIU outperforms standard unlearning methods on CelebA, Waterbirds, and FairFace datasets; for example it achieves 69.0% group accuracy (GA) on CelebA compared with next best of 66.2%, preserving model robustness. The principle implication is that AI practitioners should use distribution reweighting and mutual information-based techniques to mitigate fairness issues in machine unlearning scenarios where data removal requests are not uniformly distributed across groups.  |

The main research question is how to combine the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and graph search to find cost-efficient tool paths for multi-turn image editing. The key methodology is a three-stage approach called CoSTA* that uses LLMs to create a subtask tree, prunes a graph of AI tools, and then conducts A* search on the subgraph to find a tool path, guided by a combination of cost and quality metrics. CoSTA* achieved an overall accuracy of 0.94 across all tasks, outperforming baselines such as GenArtist (0.73) and CLOVA (0.63) and offers dynamic trade-offs between the computational cost and quality. This implies that AI practitioners can leverage CoSTA* to build more efficient and adaptable image editing systems that can handle complex, multi-turn editing instructions, allowing for dynamic parameter adjustments of quality-cost trade-offs.  |

  Transforms (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09837) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.09837))| Saquib Sarfraz, Hasnain Ali, Ahmad Mustafa Anis | This paper investigates the limitations of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in comprehending basic image transformations. The main research question is: "Can Vision Language Embedding Models understand simple Image Transformations?".

  Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09573) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.09573))| Zhixuan Qi, Zhihan Yang, Justin T Chiu, Aaron Gokaslan, Marianne Arriola | Block Diffusion Language Models (BD3-LMs) interpolate between discrete denoising diffusion and autoregressive models, enabling flexible-length generation and improved inference efficiency. The main research objective is to introduce and evaluate a class of language models that overcome limitations of both autoregressive and diffusion models, specifically addressing fixed-length generation, inference inefficiency, and perplexity gaps. The key methodology involves defining an autoregressive distribution over blocks of tokens, where the conditional probability of each block is specified by a discrete denoising diffusion model, and employing custom training algorithms and data-driven noise schedules. On the LM1B benchmark, BD3-LMs achieved a test perplexity of 28.23 with a block size of 4, outperforming previous diffusion models and closing gap with the AR perplexity of 22.88 . AI practitioners can leverage BD3-LMs for generating arbitrary-length sequences with improved likelihood modeling compared to standard diffusion models, and with parallel generation capabilities beyond autoregressive models.  |

The key methodology is to formalize test-time compute optimization as a meta-reinforcement learning problem, using a dense reward bonus based on "progress" quantified by the change in likelihood of eventual success. MRT leads to a 2-3x relative gain in performance and roughly a 1.5x gain in token efficiency for math reasoning compared to outcome-reward RL. For AI practitioners, MRT provides a new fine-tuning method that improves LLM performance and efficiency by optimizing for progress during inference, enabling better utilization of computational resources.  |

| Should VLMs be Pre-trained with Image Data? (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07603) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.07603))| Igor Vasiljevic, Kushal Arora, Samir Yitzhak Gadre, Jean Mercat, Sedrick Keh | Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can be improved by incorporating image data during pre-training, before the model is fully pre-trained with text. The main research question is when and how image data should be introduced during VLM pre-training to optimize downstream performance on vision-language and text-only tasks. Researchers trained approximately 300 models, systematically varying text-only pre-training amounts, image-text ratios, and fine-tuning stages using a decoder-only transformer architecture with a frozen image encoder. A key finding is that, for a 1B parameter model, introducing visual tokens 80% of the way through pre-training leads to a 2% average improvement on vision-language tasks compared to introducing them after full pre-training. The results suggest that AI practitioners should integrate image data earlier in VLM pre-training, but not immediately, to maintain text performance, instead of following traditional separate training phases.  |

| L$^2$M: Mutual Information Scaling Law for Long-Context Language Modeling (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04725) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.04725))| Marin Soljačić, Di Luo, Zhuotao Jin, oriolmayne, zhuoc3 | This paper establishes a theoretical framework for understanding and improving long-context language modeling based on a bipartite mutual information scaling law. The main research question is how a language model's capacity to handle long-range dependencies scales with its internal state size and sequence length. The key methodology involves proving a "Long-context Language Modeling (L²M)" condition, theoretically relating model state size to bipartite mutual information, and empirically validating this scaling law using transformer and state space models on text datasets. The primary result is that bipartite mutual information in natural language scales as I ~ L^β (where β is between 0 and 1) and that a model's state size must grow at least as fast as I ~ L^β for effective long-context modeling. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that designing models for long-context tasks requires careful consideration of the history state's scaling, with transformers naturally satisfying this condition and other architectures (like SSMs) needing model size increases to maintain performance at longer sequence lengths.  |

The main research objective is to address limitations of existing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) methods, specifically lack of high-quality expert interactions and inefficient extension to attention blocks. Key methodology involves equivalent expert decomposition on MLP and attention blocks via matrix partition, two routing paradigms (patch-wise data and expert selection), and parallel implementation of routing/computation. Primary results show UoE achieves an average perplexity reduction of 2.38 on language modeling tasks compared to the best-performed MoE method, using only 76% of the FLOPs. Principal implication for AI practitioners is that UoE offers a more efficient and performant approach to building transformer-based models, directly applicable to large-scale language and vision tasks.  |

The main research objective is to evaluate the prevalence of translationese in LLM-generated translations and investigate its origins during supervised training.  The key methodology involves human annotation to identify translationese spans, analysis of training data, and mitigation strategies such as refining training references and filtering unnatural instances using perplexity.  The primary results show that even advanced models like GPT-4 exhibit substantial translationese, with over 40% of their translations containing substantial translationese patterns, and that refining training data with LLMs reduces perplexity by 7.8 in the English-Chinese dataset.  Principal implication for AI practitioners is that addressing translationese bias in SFT data, by polishing golden references or filtering, can improve the naturalness of LLM translation outputs.  |
| Combining Flow Matching and Transformers for Efficient Solution of Bayesian Inverse Problems (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01375) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.01375))| Ekaterina Muravleva, oseledets, dsherki | The paper introduces a method combining Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) and transformers to efficiently solve Bayesian inverse problems. The main objective is to recover the distribution of model parameters conditioned on observed experimental data, given a series of observations and a forward model.

The results demonstrate that GEN3C achieves a PSNR of 18.66 and an SSIM of 0.67 on the Tanks-and-Temples dataset for single-view video generation, outperforming baselines. For AI practitioners, GEN3C offers a method for generating 3D-consistent videos with precise camera control by conditioning video generation on 3D renderings, improving controllability and consistency compared to prior video generation models.  |

The methodology involves a three-step pipeline: coding question synthesis from 12 sources, solution and test generation with self-verification, and post-training data synthesis via question rewriting and test-based rejection sampling using DeepSeek-R1. Models fine-tuned on KODCODE-SFT achieved a 61.26% average score across five coding benchmarks, outperforming models like Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B. The principal implication is that AI practitioners can use KODCODE to improve the performance of code LLMs in supervised fine-tuning and potentially RL training, with verified solutions and tests offering advantages for various code-related tasks.  |

The main research objective is to investigate whether multi-dimensional signals derived from multiple LLMs can enhance the selection of synthetic instruction-response pairs for instruction tuning. The key methodology involves calculating three metrics (Difficulty, Separability, Stability) from multiple LLM responses and reward model assessments, and then integrating these with a clustering-based approach for diverse data selection. Primary results show that CROWDSELECT achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving instruction tuning by 4.81% on Arena-Hard and 11.1% on MT-bench with Llama-3.2-3b-instruct.

| QE4PE: Word-level Quality Estimation for Human Post-Editing (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03044) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.03044))| Malvina Nissim, Ana Guerberof-Arenas, Grzegorz Chrupała, Vilém Zouhar, gsarti | The QE4PE study investigates the impact of word-level quality estimation (QE) on professional machine translation post-editing, finding that factors beyond QE accuracy influence its real-world usefulness. The main research objective was to measure the effect of word-level QE error span highlighting on the editing quality, productivity, and usability in a realistic post-editing workflow. The methodology involved 42 professional translators post-editing machine-translated texts in English-Italian and English-Dutch, using four highlight modalities (supervised, unsupervised, oracle, and no highlights) and logging their editing behavior. Results showed that highlight modalities are not solely predictive of editing time and that cross-modality highlight overlap ranged between 15% and 39%. This implies that AI practitioners should consider factors beyond accuracy, such as domain, language, and user-specific factors, to improve the integration of word-level QE in post-editing tools and enhance their real-world usability.  |
| Exploring Rewriting Approaches for Different Conversational Tasks (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18860) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.18860))| Xiang Chen, Mike Rimer, Ryan A. Rossi, Md Mehrab Tanjim, Franck-Dernoncourt | This paper systematically investigates query rewriting and fusion approaches for conversational AI tasks. The main research question is whether a single LLM-based query rewrite module can be universally effective across diverse conversational scenarios or if specialized modules are needed. The key methodology involves evaluating two parameterized query rewriting approaches (query rewrite and query fusion) on three datasets: conversational text-based Q&A and two text-to-visualization tasks (short and long conversations). The primary result is that for the conversational text-based Q&A task, the query rewrite approach achieved a 3.9% higher mean cosine similarity than query fusion, while for long text-to-vis tasks, query fusion had 7.6% high mean cosine similarity. The principal implication is that AI practitioners should select a query rewriting approach (either query rewrite and query fusion) that aligns with the specific conversational task and data characteristics, as no single approach is universally superior.  |

| Mixture of Structural-and-Textual Retrieval over Text-rich Graph Knowledge Bases (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20317) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.20317))| Ryan A. Rossi, Haoyu Han, Yongjia Lei, mhalappa, Franck-Dernoncourt | This paper proposes a Mixture of Structural-and-Textual Retrieval (MoR) framework for answering queries over text-rich graph knowledge bases (TG-KBs). The main research objective is to develop a retrieval method that effectively combines both textual and structural information from TG-KBs to improve query answering performance. The key methodology is a Planning-Reasoning-Organizing framework, where the Planning stage generates textual planning graphs, the Reasoning stage interweaves structural traversal and textual matching, and the Organizing stage reranks candidates based on their structural trajectory. The primary result shows that MoR achieved an average Hit@1 score of 48.93%, outperforming other baselines on three TG-KB datasets. The principal implication is that AI practitioners can leverage MoR's mixture-of-experts approach to improve retrieval performance in applications that use the graph knowledge bases by harmonizing textual and structural signals, especially useful to combine and rank structural knowledge from graph data with traditional text features.  |
| Retrieval Models Aren't Tool-Savvy: Benchmarking Tool Retrieval for Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01763) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.01763))| Shuaiqiang Wang, Pengjie Ren, Lingyong Yan, Yuhan Wang, Zhengliang Shi | The paper introduces TOOLRET, a new benchmark for evaluating information retrieval (IR) models on tool retrieval tasks for large language models (LLMs). The main research objective is to assess the performance of existing IR models in retrieving relevant tools for LLMs in diverse, real-world scenarios, and to analyze the impact of retrieval quality on end-to-end task performance. The key methodology involves collecting and curating a large-scale dataset of 7.6k retrieval tasks and 43k tools from existing datasets, evaluating various IR models (sparse, dense, and re-ranking) on this benchmark, and contributing a large scale training dataset (TOOLRET-train) to improve retrieval performance. A primary result is that the best-performing model (NV-embedd-v1) achieves an nDCG@10 of only 33.83 on the benchmark, indicating existing IR models struggle with tool retrieval. The principal implication is that AI practitioners need to develop new retrieval methods tailored for tool retrieval, or improve upon current methods using target-aware reasoning and large-scale training data, as shown in the paper using TOOLRET-train, since current strong IR models are not effective for tool retrieval.  |

The main research objective is to investigate the effectiveness of various LLMs in predicting software vulnerabilities, comparing them with smaller language models (SLMs) and static application security testing (SAST) tools, and exploring strategies to improve LLM performance. The key methodology involves compiling a multi-language dataset (Python, Java, JavaScript) of vulnerable functions, evaluating five open-source LLMs using prompt engineering, instruction tuning, and sequence classification fine-tuning, and comparing them against SLMs and SAST tools. The results show that fine-tuned LLMs achieved the best F1-score of 0.443 on the JavaScript dataset, with performance varying significantly across programming languages and adaptation strategies. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that while LLMs show promise for SVD, particularly in JavaScript with fine-tuning, performance is highly dependent on data characteristics, requiring careful consideration of language, model selection, and adaptation strategies.  |

The main objective is to enhance AVs' real-time decision-making and intent expression capabilities in complex driving scenarios with heterogeneous HVs. The methodology involves a parallel Actor-Reasoner architecture; the Reasoner uses an LLM with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to infer HV driving styles and generate eHMI displays, while the Actor employs a two-layer memory retrieval mechanism from a database constructed during training with simulated HVs. Results show that the proposed framework achieves a 94% success rate in intersection scenarios, and a memory partition module improves retrieval speed by an average of 12%. AI practitioners can use this framework as a method to integrate LLMs into real-time decision-making systems, addressing LLM inference speed limitations by combining reasoning capabilities with memory-based fast retrieval.  |

| Liger: Linearizing Large Language Models to Gated Recurrent Structures (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01496) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.01496))| Yu Cheng, JusenK, Jiaxihu2, weigao266, landisen | Liger transforms pretrained Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) into gated linear recurrent structures for efficient deployment. The main research objective is to linearize LLMs into gated recurrent structures without adding extra parameters and with minimal performance loss.

| When an LLM is apprehensive about its answers -- and when its uncertainty is justified (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01688) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.01688))| Alexey Zaytsev, Edvard Khalafyan, DanielVyazhev, aigoncharov, sspetya | The paper investigates uncertainty estimation in Large Language Models (LLMs) for multiple-choice question answering, focusing on entropy and model-as-judge (MASJ) approaches. The main research question is how well token-wise entropy and MASJ estimates reflect LLM error and question difficulty across different domains and reasoning requirements. The key methodology involves evaluating three LLMs (Phi-4, Mistral, Qwen) on the MMLU-Pro dataset, using an auxiliary LLM to label questions by reasoning/knowledge needs and comparing uncertainty estimates with correctness labels. A primary result is that response entropy predicts model error effectively in knowledge-dependent domains (biology ROC AUC = 0.73), but this correlation weakens for reasoning-dependent domains (math ROC AUC = 0.55). For AI practioners this indicates, that the data-uncertainty related entropy is a useful measure in uncertainty estimate frameworks and should be integrated, but its usefulness is dependent to how much reasoning is requred to solve the problem.  |

| Word Form Matters: LLMs' Semantic Reconstruction under Typoglycemia (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01714) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.01714))| Lang Gao, Zhongyu Wei, Ziruibest, Carol0110, Aurora-cx | Large Language Models (LLMs) reconstruct the meaning of scrambled words primarily using word form, with minimal reliance on contextual information. The main research question is how word form and contextual information influence LLMs' semantic reconstruction ability under Typoglycemia. The researchers used controlled experiments on LLaMA models, varying Scramble Ratio (SR) and Context Integrity (CI), and introduced SemRecScore to quantify semantic reconstruction. Primary results show SemRecScore decreases as SR increases, and at a Scramble Ratio (SR) of 1, a final SemRecScore of only 0.5 is achieved on the final LLM layer, indicating incomplete semantic reconstruction. For AI practitioners, this highlights that improvements can come by incorporating human-like, context-aware mechanisms, as current attention mechanisms focus primarily on the word form.  |

| Can Large Language Models Detect Errors in Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning? (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19361) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.19361))| Weixun Wang, Jiaheng Liu, Shilong Li, Yancheng He, zhangysk | DeltaBench, a new benchmark, evaluates large language models' (LLMs) ability to detect errors in long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. The main research objective is to assess the quality of long CoTs generated by o1-like models and to measure the critique abilities of existing LLMs, process reward models (PRMs) and critic models on these CoTs. The key methodology involves creating DeltaBench, a dataset of long CoTs with fine-grained error annotations, and evaluating various LLMs, including PRMs and critic models, on their ability to identify these errors. Primary results show that even the top-performing model (GPT-4-turbo-128k) achieved a low F1-score of only 40.8% in error detection, and that o1-like models do not show any advantage over non-o1-like models on critique abilities. Principal implication for AI practitioners is that current LLMs, including PRMs, have limited ability to identify errors in long CoT reasoning, highlighting a need for significant improvements in critique capabilities for robust AI system development.  |
| Agentic Reward Modeling: Integrating Human Preferences with Verifiable Correctness Signals for Reliable Reward Systems (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19328) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.19328))| Bin Xu, Zijun Yao, Xiaozhi Wang, Yunjia Qi, Hao Peng | This paper proposes a new reward modeling approach, "agentic reward modeling," that combines human preferences with verifiable correctness signals for more reliable reward systems in large language models (LLMs).  The main research objective is to develop a reward system that mitigates the limitations of existing reward models, which primarily focus on subjective human preferences and often neglect verifiable correctness.  The key methodology involves implementing a reward agent, REWARDAGENT, that integrates human preference rewards with two verifiable signals: factuality (assessed via pairwise comparison and evidence verification) and instruction-following (verified through constraint parsing and Python code execution).  The primary results show that REWARDAGENT significantly outperforms existing reward models on benchmarks like RM-Bench, JudgeBench, and a newly constructed IFBench, achieving an overall score of 72.5% in one configuration.  The principal implication for AI practitioners is that integrating verifiable correctness signals with human preference feedback can lead to more reliable and robust reward models, improving LLM performance in downstream tasks and alignment with intended behavior, particularly during the inference and training phases.  |
| Language Models' Factuality Depends on the Language of Inquiry (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17955) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.17955))| Hamid Palangi, Kumar Ayush, Kumar Tanmay, ayush1801, AggarwalTushar | Language models (LMs) exhibit inconsistent factual recall across different languages, failing to transfer knowledge even when possessing it in one language. The main research question is whether multilingual LMs truly internalize and transfer factual knowledge across languages or encode isolated linguistic silos. The key methodology involves creating a benchmark of 10,000 country-related facts across 13 languages and proposing metrics (Factual Recall Score, Knowledge Transferability Score, Cross-Lingual Factual Knowledge Transferability Score) to quantify factual recall and knowledge transferability. A primary result is that Llama-3-70B achieved the highest X-FaKT score of 0.848, demonstrating superior balanced performance in both factual recall and knowledge transfer. The principal implication is that AI practitioners must recognize language-specific factual reliability in multilingual LMs and leverage the most trustworthy information across languages, moving beyond the assumption of consistent cross-lingual knowledge access.  |
| Can Language Models Falsify? Evaluating Algorithmic Reasoning with Counterexample Creation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19414) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.19414))| Matthias Bethge, Jonas Geiping, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru, Shashwat Goel, Shiven Sinha | Language models (LMs) are evaluated on their ability to generate counterexamples that falsify incorrect algorithmic solutions, introducing a new benchmark called REFUTE. The main research question is: Can LMs create counterexamples for incorrect solutions to algorithmic problems? The key methodology involves sourcing incorrect submissions from programming competitions, filtering them for non-trivial errors, and prompting LMs to generate inputs that cause these solutions to fail, validated through code execution. The primary result is that the best reasoning agents, including OpenAI 03-mini (high), can only create counterexamples for less than 9% of incorrect solutions in REFUTE, despite having a much higher success rate at solving those same problems. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that verification, including falsification of subtly incorrect solutions, is significantly harder for current LMs than generating correct solutions, highlighting a limitation in capabilities relevant for self-improvement and reliable reasoning.  |

The main research objective is to develop an AI system capable of formulating demonstrably novel research hypotheses and proposals, building upon existing evidence and aligned with scientist-provided goals. The key methodology involves a multi-agent architecture with an asynchronous task execution framework, utilizing a generate, debate, and evolve approach with specialized agents for hypothesis generation, refinement, and ranking via simulated scientific debates and tournaments. The system demonstrates, across 203 diverse research goals, improved hypothesis quality (measured by an internal Elo rating system) as a function of increased test-time compute, and hypotheses for acute myeloid leukemia were validated to show tumor inhibition *in vitro* at clinically applicable concentrations. AI practitioners can leverage the multi-agent architecture and test-time compute scaling paradigm presented to build systems capable of complex reasoning and iterative improvement, although specific external validation metrics remain limited within the paper.  |

The main research question is: How do current language models perform on core Greek financial tasks, and how can fine-tuning on Greek financial data enhance performance?  Key methodology involved creating Plutus-ben, comprising five financial NLP tasks (numeric and textual NER, QA, abstractive summarization, topic classification), and fine-tuning Llama-Krikri-8B with Greek domain-specific data to create Plutus-8B, evaluating 22 LLMs.  The primary result is that Plutus-8B achieved the best performance on Plutus-ben, surpassing GPT-4 by 15.38% and outperforming all baseline models in the evaluation.  Principal implication for AI practitioners is that fine-tuning on language-specific and domain-specific data is crucial for LLM performance in low-resource languages like Greek, significantly improving performance in tasks like financial numeric reasoning.  |

The main research objective is to enhance zero-shot MDE by addressing the limitations of existing depth normalization strategies in pseudo-label distillation. The key methodology involves Cross-Context Distillation, integrating global and local depth cues, and a multi-teacher distillation framework using diverse depth estimation models. The primary result shows that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets; for instance, on the DIODE dataset, the AbsRel improves by 14.1% using the Local-Global and Shared-Context Distillation strategies. For AI practitioners, this method provides an effective way to train more robust and accurate MDE models by leveraging unlabeled data and combining the strengths of multiple teacher models, especially improving generalization in varied scenarios.  |
| Project Alexandria: Towards Freeing Scientific Knowledge from Copyright Burdens via LLMs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19413) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.19413))| Andreas Hochlehnert, Tawsif Ahmed, Ameya Prabhu, Gollam Rabby, Christoph Schuhmann | This paper proposes converting copyrighted scientific texts into structured "Knowledge Units" using LLMs to make factual information freely accessible while respecting copyright. The main research question is whether converting scientific texts into Knowledge Units preserves factual information and adheres to copyright laws. The key methodology involves using LLMs to extract entities, attributes, and relationships from paragraphs of scientific papers into structured data, and evaluating the legal defensibility and information retention via question-answering experiments. Primary results show that language models answering multiple-choice questions using Knowledge Units achieved nearly the same accuracy (within 3-5% variance) as when using original texts across several scientific domains. AI practitioners can utilize this framework to build and use datasets containing facts from copyrighted scientific text, potentially democratizing access to scholarly knowledge without infringing on the original expression.  |

The main research objective is to address the saturation of existing LLM reasoning benchmarks, particularly BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), by creating a more challenging and diverse set of tasks. The methodology involves replacing each of the 23 tasks in BBH with a novel, more difficult task that probes similar reasoning capabilities, using a semi-adversarial approach with two reference models to ensure sufficient difficulty. The primary result is that the best general-purpose model achieved a harmonic mean accuracy of 9.8% on BBEH, while the best reasoning-specialized model achieved 44.8%, indicating significant room for improvement. AI practitioners should use BBEH to evaluate LLMs for robust general reasoning, revealing current limitations and driving improvements instead of using other benchmarks where LLMs have reached ceiling performance.  |
| CritiQ: Mining Data Quality Criteria from Human Preferences (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19279) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.19279))| Zhiheng Xi, Tianyi Liang, Qipeng Guo, Kai Lv, KYLN24 | CritiQ is a novel data selection method that automatically mines data quality criteria from human preferences and performs efficient data selection. The main research objective is to develop a method for automatically extracting data quality criteria from human preferences with minimal human annotation effort. The key methodology, CritiQ Flow, employs a manager agent to evolve quality criteria and worker agents to make pairwise judgments based on a knowledge base and a reflection process. Accuracies on human-annotated test sets reach 89.33% for code, 84.57% for math, and 88.06% for logic, outperforming baselines such as TextGrad and single-criterion methods. AI practitioners can use CritiQ to automatically derive data quality criteria and select high-quality subsets, improving model performance on downstream tasks with reduced reliance on manually designed heuristics or extensive human annotation.  |

| PosterSum: A Multimodal Benchmark for Scientific Poster Summarization (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17540) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.17540))| Frank Keller, Pasquale Minervini, rohitsaxena | POSTERSUM, a new benchmark, evaluates multimodal models on summarizing scientific posters into research paper abstracts, revealing limitations in current models and introducing a hierarchical approach for improvement.  **Main research question or objective:** How effectively can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) understand and summarize the complex, visually-rich content of scientific posters into concise textual abstracts, and can a hierarchical approach improve this performance?  **Key methodology used:** The authors created a new dataset, POSTERSUM, consisting of 16,305 scientific posters paired with their corresponding abstracts. They benchmarked state-of-the-art MLLMs (including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0, and various open-source models) on this dataset using metrics like ROUGE, SacreBLEU, METEOR, and BERTScore. They then proposed "SEGMENT & SUMMARIZE," a hierarchical approach involving segmentation of the poster into coherent regions, localized summarization of each region, and global summarization to combine the localized summaries.  **Primary results:** State-of-the-art MLLMs struggle to accurately summarize scientific posters. The best-performing closed-source model, GPT-4o, achieved a ROUGE-L score of only 22.30. The proposed SEGMENT & SUMMARIZE method significantly outperformed all other models, including closed-source MLLMs, achieving a ROUGE-L score of 24.18.  **Principal implication for AI practitioners:** Current MLLMs, while strong on various tasks, have significant limitations when handling the complex multimodal information presented in scientific posters. The POSTERSUM dataset provides a valuable benchmark for advancing multimodal understanding, and the "SEGMENT & SUMMARIZE" approach demonstrates a promising direction for improving performance by incorporating a divide-and-conquer strategy, handling the complexity inherent in poster summarization. AI/ML/Software Engineers and Data Scientist working with scientific documents should prioritize models and architectures that are capable of understanding a variety of modalities and their combinations.  |

The method achieved a CLIP score of 69.4% and a DINO score of 46.9% for subject similarity, outperforming existing methods. AI practitioners can use K-LoRA to effectively fuse separately trained subject and style LoRAs, enabling efficient customized image generation without retraining, simplifying the process of generating images with specific content and styles.  |

Primary results include showing that retrieval augmented generation can provide a compressed model equivalent performance. For instance Table 2 shows that Llama-3-Ins8B with RAG achieves a 59.8 accuracy score in the PopQA. The principal implication for AI practitioners is to focus on preserving specific abilities, like retrieval from prompts and long-context reasoning when developing LLM compression techniques, rather than solely focusing on perplexity or basic task accuracy.  |

The main research objective is to develop a color constancy method that generalizes well across different camera sensors without requiring sensor-specific training. The key methodology involves fine-tuning a diffusion-based inpainting model to insert a color checker into an image, then using Laplacian decomposition to maintain checker structure and extract illumination color from the inpainted checker's achromatic squares. In cross-dataset evaluations, GCC achieved a worst-25% error rate of 5.15° and 4.32° in bi-directional evaluations. AI practitioners can leverage this method to estimate the illumination with good accuracy, across a wide range of sensors without specific sensor training data.  |

The main research question is whether test-time scaling confers cross-lingual benefits in mathematical reasoning similar to those observed with pre-training scaling. The authors test three test-time scaling methods (Outcome Reward Modeling, Process Reward Modeling, and Budget Forcing) on multilingual LLMs using a new benchmark, MCLM, featuring competition-level problems in 55 languages. A primary result is that using Qwen2.5-1.5B Math with Outcome Reward Modeling achieves a score of 35.8 on MCLM, while Budget Forcing on MR1-1.5B attains 35.2, showing that gains from test-time scaling do not consistently extend to multiple languages. The principal implication is that AI practitioners should be aware that test-time scaling methods may not generalize effectively to multilingual tasks, and improving multilingual robustness requires methods beyond simply increasing inference-time compute.  |

The main research objective is to understand and mitigate the failure modes (temporal repetition and slow motion) of existing length extrapolation methods in video diffusion transformers. The key methodology is analyzing the role of frequency components in Rotational Position Embedding (RoPE) and reducing the "intrinsic frequency" component that governs repetition patterns. Primary results show that RIFLEX achieves 2x extrapolation on CogVideoX-5B in a training-free manner, with a NoRepeat Score of 54.2 and Dynamic Degree of 59.4. The principal implication is that AI practitioners can achieve high-quality length extrapolation in video generation without additional training or significant modifications to existing models by simply adjusting the intrinsic frequency in the positional encoding.  |

| Can Community Notes Replace Professional Fact-Checkers? (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14132) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.14132))| Isabelle Augenstein, Desmond Elliott, gretawarren, Nadav | This research investigates the reliance of Twitter/X's Community Notes on professional fact-checking for combating misinformation. The main research questions are to what extent community notes rely on the work of professional fact-checkers and what are the traits of posts and notes that reference fact-checking sources. The researchers annotated a corpus of Twitter/X community notes using language models and performed manual annotations, classifying cited sources and identifying attributes like topic and refutation strategies. A primary result is that at least 5% of all English community notes contain an external link to professional fact-checkers, rising to 7% for notes rated as 'helpful'.

The main research objective is to create and evaluate a collection of large-scale time series datasets to improve benchmarking in time series classification.  Key methodologies include compiling 29 univariate and multivariate datasets, processing them into a common format, and evaluating baseline methods (ConvTran, FCN, HInceptionTime, TempCNN, HYDRA, QUANT, and ET) using 5-fold cross-validation.  Primary results show that QUANT achieved the lowest overall mean 0-1 loss (0.1880) across all datasets, closely followed by ConvTran (0.1954), although performance varied significantly across different data categories.  Principal implication for AI practioners is that that the field has artificially disadvanted low-bias methods and MONSTER can improve development and application in time series classification by training models on larger datasets.  |
| The snake in the Brownian sphere (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13074) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13074))| Grégory Miermont, Brett Kolesnik, Emmanuel Jacob, Omer Angel | The paper describes the inverse of the continuous Cori-Vauquelin-Schaeffer (CVS) bijection, mapping the Brownian sphere to the Brownian snake. The main research objective is to construct the Brownian snake as a measurable function of the Brownian sphere, thereby inverting the continuous CVS bijection. The key methodology involves using the geometric notion of a cut locus on the Brownian sphere, defining a metric on the closure of the cut locus, and leveraging the induced orientation to define a planar order. The primary result is that, given a Brownian sphere (X,d,µ) and two independent points drawn from µ, there exists a measurable function outputting an R-tree T and label function Z such that T has the law of the Continuum Random Tree (CRT), and applying the continuum CVS mapping to (T, Z) recovers (X, d, μ). The paper proves that the orientation of the Brownian Sphere has a Rademacher distribution (equal to ±1 with equal probability), independently of the random variables ψ(h). AI/ML/Software Engineers/Data Scientist, can measurably recover the Brownian Snake and its associated tree structure from a given a Brownian Sphere, which provides new mathematical tooling and foundational understanding for models related to random planar maps.  |

The key methodology involves distilling multi-aspect image captioning capabilities from online Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into a local MLLM via LoRA fine-tuning, and employing an xLSTM feature extractor with a regression head to predict Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs). The method achieved a Spearman's Rank-Order Correlation Coefficient (SRCC) of 0.9045 and a Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) of 0.9317 on the quality aspect of the AGIQA-3k dataset. AI practitioners can utilize this framework to more accurately and comprehensively evaluate the quality of generated images, considering multiple factors that go beyond simple perceptual quality.  |

(Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15657) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.15657))| Pietro Greiner, Joumana Ghosn, Damiano Fornasiere, Michael Cohen, Yoshua Bengio | This paper proposes "Scientist AI," a non-agentic AI design, as a safer alternative to increasingly capable generalist agentic AI systems that pose catastrophic risks. The main research objective is to design a non-agentic AI that is trustworthy and safe by design, minimizing risks associated with uncontrolled agentic AI. The key methodology is a Bayesian approach with a world model generating causal theories and an inference machine for probabilistic question answering, operating with explicit uncertainty quantification. The paper presents the abstract view that as training data, objectives, and models scale for agentic AI, goal misgeneralization becomes more likely. This is contrasted with the proposal that the proposed non-agentic design improves in safety and accuracy with additional computing power. For AI practitioners, the principal implication is that focusing development on non-agentic AI, specifically "Scientist AI," may enable benefits of AI innovation while avoiding risks associated with the current agent-driven trajectory.  |

The main research question is whether more capable models within a single family require a longer chain-of-thought (more reasoning tokens) to achieve higher performance, or if they reason more effectively. The key methodology involves a systematic analysis of chain-of-thought length and accuracy across o1-mini and o3-mini variants on the Omni-MATH benchmark, using logistic regression to quantify effects. The primary results are that the o3-mini (m) achieves superior accuracy without requiring longer reasoning chains than o1-mini, and accuracy generally declines as reasoning chains grow, with a diminishing rate as proficiency goes up; Specifically, accuracy decreased by 3.16% per 1000 reasoning tokens for o1-mini and 1.96% for o3-mini (m). The principal implication is that, for mathematical reasoning tasks, constraining the chain-of-thought might be beneficial for weaker models; newer models exhibit more efficient reasoning, and less is more.  |

The main research objective is to determine how measurable attributes of the forget set drive collateral effects during unlearning and whether these attributes can be controlled to optimize the deletion effectiveness/model utility trade-off. The key methodology involves using Isolation Forests to identify and prune high-variance outlier data points in the forget set's hidden state representations, forming a lower-variance "core" forget set used for unlearning. Primary results show that UPCORE achieves a higher area-under-the-curve (AUC) score (0.387) compared to unlearning on the complete set (0.343) and random subset (0.353) using Gradient Ascent, across standard metrics, indicating improved balance between deletion and utility preservation.

(Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14502) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.14502))| Vasily Konovalov, Daniil Moskovskiy, Maria Marina, msalnikov, memyprokotow | This paper investigates how much new factual knowledge can be incorporated into a Large Language Model (LLM) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) without compromising pre-existing knowledge. The main research objective is to determine the extent to which new facts can be integrated into an LLM via a LoRA adapter while preserving general capabilities. The key methodology involves fine-tuning a Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model using LoRA with varying amounts of new knowledge (DBpedia triples) and evaluating performance on external benchmarks (MMLU, TruthfulQA) and internal metrics (knowledge shifts). A primary result is that a model trained on 500 unknown facts, achieved 100% reliability on test, while models trained with additional highly-known data could see minimized negative shifts; Accuracy of models trained on MMLU with added 10 HighlyKnown or paraphrased sample show a significant drop in accuracy. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that while LoRA is effective for incorporating new knowledge, there is a trade-off between new knowledge integration, reduced truthfulness and general reasoning capabilities, requiring careful consideration of training data composition.  |

The main research objective is to address the limitation of existing VLMs in generating coherent outputs beyond 1,000 words, despite their ability to process long visual and textual contexts.  Key methodology involved creating a new dataset, LongWriter-V-22k, with 22,158 examples of multi-image inputs and long text outputs (up to 10,000 words), and proposing IterDPO, a modified direct preference optimization method for long text.  Primary results show that the 7B parameter model trained with LongWriter-V-22k and IterDPO outperformed larger proprietary models like GPT-4o on the MMLongBench-Write benchmark, achieving an overall score of 84.6, including component scores of 86.2 (length) and 82.9 (quality).

| How Much Do LLMs Hallucinate across Languages? On Multilingual Estimation of LLM Hallucination in the Wild (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12769) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.12769))| Goran Glavaš, Anne Lauscher, saadob12 | This paper investigates the extent of hallucination in large language models (LLMs) across 30 languages in open-domain, knowledge-intensive question answering.  The main research question is: How frequently do LLMs hallucinate across different languages and model sizes in a "real-world" question-answering setting, and how does this relate to language resource availability?  Key methodology: The researchers trained a multilingual hallucination detection model using machine-translated English data and created a multilingual evaluation dataset (MFAVA) with LLM-generated and human-annotated examples. They then estimated hallucination rates for six open-source LLM families across 30 languages using a novel protocol based on the detection model's performance.  Primary results: Smaller LLMs and those supporting more languages exhibited significantly higher hallucination rates. The average hallucination rate across languages varied from 7% to 12%. However, there was no correlation between language-normalized hallucination rates and digital language representation.  Principal implication for AI practitioners: AI practitioners should be aware that smaller LLM model sizes and models designed for broad multilingual support may be more prone to generating non-factual or unfaithful content in question-answering tasks, necessitating careful model selection and potentially requiring additional mitigation strategies.  |

They evaluate on four datasets of varying document types/lengths, using position-aware and position-agnostic training.  4.  **Primary Results:** Fine-tuning on SUnsET significantly improves evidence extraction and citation accuracy across multiple LLMs and datasets. A key quantitative finding is citation rates increase dramatically: (6.8× for Mixtral 8x7B with position-aware training). Training also improves summary quality, though shuffling document sections during training can mitigate positional biases.  5.  **Principal Implication for AI Practitioners:** AI practitioners can use the SUnsET dataset and fine-tuning approach to adapt LLMs for improved unstructured evidence citation in long-context summarization, leading to more transparent and reliable summaries, but must be aware that current methods are prone to errors.  |

The methodology involves a Mixture-of-Memories (MoM) architecture with multiple independent memory states and a router network that directs input tokens to specific memory states, using an RNN-like update mechanism. Primary results show that MoM significantly outperforms current linear sequence models on downstream language tasks, with the 1.3B parameter MoM achieving an average score of 36.04 on recall-intensive tasks, close to the Transformer model's 37.31. For AI practitioners, MoM offers a more efficient architecture to enhance the memory and recall of linear sequence modeling for applications, retaining linear-time training and constant-memory inference, presenting itself as an alternative to Transformers.  |

The key methodology is to use a pretraining influence scorer, derived from data-filtering pipelines, to score newly discovered documents and prioritize them in the crawler's queue, replacing traditional graph-connectivity-based metrics. Primary results show that LLMs pretrained on data crawled by CRAW4LLM, using only 21% of the URLs, achieve the same downstream performance as previous crawls that used more data. Principal implication is that by using CRAW4LLM AI practitioners can get similar performing LLM, while significantly reducing the required web crawling and data processing, thus saving time and resources.  |
| LongPO: Long Context Self-Evolution of Large Language Models through Short-to-Long Preference Optimization (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13922) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13922))| Lidong Bing, Michael Qizhe Shieh, Xin Li, Guanzheng Chen | LongPO is a method that enables short-context LLMs to self-evolve to handle long-context tasks by internally transferring short-context capabilities through preference optimization. The main research objective is to address the challenges of long-context alignment in LLMs, specifically the scarcity of long-context annotated data and the difficulty in balancing short- and long-context performance. The key methodology involves generating short-to-long preference data using a short-context LLM and applying a DPO-style objective with a KL constraint to maintain short-context performance. The primary result is that LongPO applied to Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 improved performance on InfiniteBench by 25.45 points and achieved comparable or superior results to larger LLMs like GPT-4-128K.

| Small Models Struggle to Learn from Strong Reasoners (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12143) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.12143))| Luyao Niu, Fengqing Jiang, Xiang Yue, Yuetai Li, flydust | Small language models (≤3B parameters) do not consistently benefit from complex reasoning data or distillation from larger models, instead performing better with simpler reasoning. The main research question is whether small language models can effectively learn from the reasoning capabilities of larger, more powerful language models. The key methodology involves fine-tuning student models of varying sizes on different types of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data (long, short, large teacher, small teacher) generated from the MATH dataset and evaluating their performance on multiple math benchmarks. A key result is that Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct improves by more than 8 points on MATH and AMC using Mix-Long, compared to direct training on long CoT data. The principal implication is that AI practitioners should adapt reasoning complexity during distillation, using techniques like Mix Distillation, to effectively transfer reasoning capabilities to smaller models, instead of directly using complex reasoning data from large models.  |

The main research objective is to reduce the end-to-end latencies of agentic programs composed of dynamic, non-deterministic DAGs of LLM calls and interrupts. The key methodology used is program-aware scheduling, prioritizing LLM calls based on program-level statistics (cumulative service time) and employing a data locality-aware load balancer across multiple engines. Primary results show that Autellix improves program throughput by 4-15x compared to state-of-the-art systems like vLLM, across diverse LLMs and agentic workloads. The principal implication is that AI practitioners can significantly improve the performance of LLM agent applications by using a serving system that prioritizes the scheduling of LLM calls based on full program execution, and data-locality, rather than treating each call independently.  |

The key methodology involves prompting LLMs with names from 30 cultures and analyzing generated responses for cultural bias using an LLM-as-a-judge approach and assertion-based evaluation.  The primary result showed that LLM responses exhibit varying degrees of cultural bias, with clothing-related queries showing a roughly 70% increase in bias when names were included.  Principal implication is that AI practitioners need to consider the impact of names on LLM outputs and design personalisation systems that avoid reinforcing stereotypes while utilizing names.  |
| Why Safeguarded Ships Run Aground? Aligned Large Language Models' Safety Mechanisms Tend to Be Anchored in The Template Region (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13946) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13946))| Wenjie Li, Jian Wang, Qingyu Yin, Chak Tou Leong | Aligned large language models (LLMs) exhibit a vulnerability where their safety mechanisms overly rely on information within a specific "template region" inserted between user input and model output. The research investigates the phenomenon of "template-anchored safety alignment" (TASA) in aligned LLMs. The methodology involves analyzing attention weight distributions, performing activation patching interventions, and probing harmfulness features across different layers and positions, and propose a detaching safety mechanism. Results show that intervening in intermediate states in template region significantly increases the likelihood of harmful initial compliance decisions, with a normalized indirect effect (NIE) showing considerable gains by patching small number of heads. The findings suggest AI practitioners should develop more robust safety alignment techniques that are less reliant on the template region for safety-related decision-making to reduce the risk of adversarial attacks.  |

The main research objective is to improve the reasoning performance of supervised fine-tuned (SFT) language models without collecting new long CoT data or repeatedly training on existing SFT datasets. The key methodology is to use readily available short CoT reasoning responses as rejected answers and existing long CoT responses as chosen answers, applying direct preference optimization (DPO) to encourage longer reasoning outputs. The primary result is that ThinkPO increases the math reasoning accuracy of SFT-ed models by 8.6% and output length by 25.9%, for example it increased performance on MATH500 of a tested model from 87.4% to 91.2%. AI practitioners can use ThinkPO as a post-SFT method to further improve the reasoning performance of their models, especially when acquiring new long CoT data is costly or repeated training leads to a performance plateau.  |
| Is That Your Final Answer? Test-Time Scaling Improves Selective Question Answering (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13962) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13962))| Benjamin Van Durme, Jeffrey Cheng, wjurayj | Test-time scaling of compute improves the performance of large language models on selective question answering by increasing confidence in correct answers. The research investigates how increasing computational budget at inference time impacts model confidence and accuracy in question answering. The methodology involves evaluating models at varying compute budgets and confidence thresholds, using a selection function that rejects answers below a confidence threshold. The results show that increasing the compute budget improves the average confidence of correct answers, and selective answering at a threshold of 0.95 dramatically improves performance in a Jeopardy setting where incorrect answers are penalized. AI practitioners should report test-time scaling performance under conditions that penalize incorrect answers ("Jeopardy Odds") in addition to traditional settings, to accurately reflect selective question answering capabilities.  |

| Noise May Contain Transferable Knowledge: Understanding Semi-supervised Heterogeneous Domain Adaptation from an Empirical Perspective (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13573) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13573))| Qiang Yang, Jian Jin, Yu Zhang, Xiaopu Zhang, yyyaoyuan | This paper empirically investigates transferable knowledge in semi-supervised heterogeneous domain adaptation (SHDA) tasks. The main research question is: "What is the transferable knowledge in SHDA?" The authors develop a unified Knowledge Transfer Framework (KTF) for SHDA and conduct extensive experiments, including manipulating source sample categories, features, and introducing synthesized noise distributions. A primary result across nearly 330 SHDA tasks is that varying source sample category orders has almost no change in the performance, i.e. average accuracy remains nearly constant. For AI practitioners, the results imply that the discriminability and transferability of the source domain, rather than the category or feature information, are the main factors for effective transfer in SHDA, meaning the choice of origin for source domains is less critical than ensuring those two qualities.  |

| Cramming 1568 Tokens into a Single Vector and Back Again: Exploring the Limits of Embedding Space Capacity (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13063) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13063))| Aydar Bulatov, Mikhail Arkhipov, mbur, yurakuratov | This work explores the maximum information capacity of language model input embeddings by compressing text sequences into trainable vectors. The main research objective is to quantify how much text can be losslessly encoded into and decoded from a fixed-size vector representation within large language models (LLMs). The key methodology involves optimizing a set of prepended "memory" vectors to minimize the cross-entropy loss when reconstructing the original text using a frozen, pre-trained LLM. The primary result is that a single vector can enable a Llama-3.1-8B model to accurately reconstruct up to 1568 tokens, and this capacity scales nearly linearly with the number of trainable vectors (e.g. 16 vectors compress 7168 tokens). The principal implication for AI practioners is that LLM input embeddings have significantly more unused capacity than typically utilized, suggesting substantial room for improved context encoding and memory augmentation in model design.  |
| SafeRoute: Adaptive Model Selection for Efficient and Accurate Safety Guardrails in Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12464) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.12464))| Minki Kang, Dong Bok Lee, hbseong, dwgnr, Seanie-lee | SafeRoute adaptively selects between a smaller and larger safety guard model to improve the trade-off between computational cost and safety performance in LLM deployments. The paper's objective is to develop a method that distinguishes "hard" examples requiring a larger safety guard model from "easy" ones that a smaller model can handle. The core of the method is SafeRoute, a trained binary router that classifies input prompt-response pairs, selectively applying the larger model only when necessary. Results show SafeRoute improves the F1 score by 13% and 10% compared to always using the smaller or larger models on the WildGuardMix test split, while utilizing the larger model on only 5.09% of the data. AI practitioners can use SafeRoute to deploy safer LLMs more efficiently, reducing computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy in detecting harmful content.  |

| Revisiting the Test-Time Scaling of o1-like Models: Do they Truly Possess Test-Time Scaling Capabilities? (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12215) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.12215))| Yunhua Zhou, Qinyuan Cheng, Zhiyuan Zeng, xpqiu, yinzhangyue | This paper investigates whether o1-like models (QwQ, R1, and LIMO) truly possess test-time scaling capabilities. The main research question is whether increasing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) length in these models consistently improves reasoning performance. The researchers systematically investigated the relationship between CoT length and accuracy, and prompted models for self-revisions, comparing sequential and parallel scaling strategies. A primary result is that longer CoTs did not consistently improve accuracy; correct solutions were often shorter, and R1-Distill-32b and R1-Distill-14b maintained the original wrong answer in over 70% of cases when prompted to revise. The principal implication is that AI practitioners should consider parallel scaling and methods like "Shortest Majority Vote" for these models, as sequential scaling via self-revision is not consistently effective due to limited self-revision capabilities.  |

| Ignore the KL Penalty! Boosting Exploration on Critical Tokens to Enhance RL Fine-Tuning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06533) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.06533))| lecraquito, Nbeau, supertardigrade | This paper investigates how varying pre-training levels affect language model exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning, and proposes a modified KL penalty to improve exploration. The main research question is how pre-training data distribution impacts exploration efficiency during RL fine-tuning of language models on tasks requiring out-of-distribution generalization. The key methodology involves pre-training a small language model on an arithmetic addition task with varying digit lengths, then fine-tuning it with RL and a modified KL penalty that prioritizes exploration on "critical tokens".

The primary results show that CoCoMix achieves comparable performance to standard next-token prediction with 21.5% fewer training tokens on a 1.38B parameter model. For AI practitioners, CoCoMix offers a more sample-efficient pretraining approach, enhances model interpretability and steerability by allowing direct inspection and modification of the predicted concept, and improves performance in weak-to-strong supervision scenarios.  |

| NoLiMa: Long-Context Evaluation Beyond Literal Matching (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05167) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.05167))| Ryan A. Rossi, Trung Bui, Hanieh Deilamsalehy, Franck-Dernoncourt, amodaresi | NOLIMA, a new benchmark, evaluates large language models' (LLMs) long-context understanding by minimizing literal keyword overlap between questions and answers, emphasizing associative reasoning.  Main research question/objective: To assess how well LLMs perform long-context reasoning when they cannot rely on simple literal matches between the question and the context, unlike typical Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH) tests.  Key methodology: The authors created the NOLIMA benchmark, extending NIAH, where questions and corresponding "needles" (answers) have minimal lexical overlap, requiring models to infer latent associations to locate the needle within a long "haystack" (irrelevant text). They tested 12 LLMs, including GPT-40, and conducted analyses with variations of reasoning complexity, context length, needle placement, and with the presence/absence of literal matching.  Primary results: Model performance degraded significantly with increasing context length; at 32K tokens, 10 of the 12 models dropped below 50% of their short-length baseline scores. GPT-4o's performance decreased from 99.3% baseline to 69.7% at 32K. The presence of literal matches drastically simplified the task, and distractors with literal matches drastically impaired the task.  Principal implication for AI practitioners: Current LLMs, even those claiming to support very long contexts, struggle with long-context associative reasoning tasks that lack surface-level (literal) cues, indicating a critical limitation that practitioners should consider when deploying these models in long-context applications.  |

The main research objective is to develop a method for merging LLMs that minimizes parameter conflicts and system costs while preserving performance across diverse tasks. The key methodology involves quantifying layer-wise parameter conflicts, adaptively averaging layers with low conflict and routing layers with high conflict, employing sparse expert decomposition, and using uncertainty-based routing for out-of-distribution samples. Primary results show that Mediator achieves significant performance improvements over existing methods; e.g. on LLaMA-3.2-8B, it achieved 71.80% average on multiple tasks. The principal implication is that AI practitioners can merge fine-tuned LLMs more efficiently to improve the performance and adaptability while reducing the storage and computational costs compared to maintaining separate models.  |

The main research objective is to develop a video generation framework that improves spatial dependency modeling and inference efficiency compared to autoregressive next-token prediction models. The key methodology shifts the generation unit from individual tokens to blocks (e.g., rows or frames), using bidirectional attention within each block and predicting multiple tokens in parallel. The NBP model achieved FVD scores of 103.3 on UCF101 and 25.5 on K600, outperforming the vanilla NTP model by an average of 4.4, with an 11x inference speedup. For AI practitioners, this framework provides a more efficient and scalable solution for video generation, maintaining or improving quality while accelerating inference through parallelization.  |
| DPO-Shift: Shifting the Distribution of Direct Preference Optimization (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07599) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.07599))| Xiao Li, Lei Zhao, Qianen Zhang, Feng Jiang, Xiliang Yang | DPO-Shift controllably shifts the distribution of chosen probabilities in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate likelihood displacement. The main research objective is to address the likelihood displacement issue in DPO, where probabilities of chosen responses decrease during training. The key methodology is introducing a parameter function, f(x), added to the rejected reward in the Bradley-Terry model, called DPO-Shift. Experimentally, DPO-Shift with f(x)=0.95 achieved a reward accuracy of 0.743 on the UltraFeedback test set, comparable to DPO's 0.739, while demonstrably increasing chosen response probability. For AI practioners, DPO-Shift offers a simple, theoretically grounded solution to improve alignment with human preferences by mitigating the likelihood displacement of standard DPO, enabling a trade-off between chosen probability and reward margin.  |

The main objective is to develop a method that enables smaller models to achieve performance comparable to larger models by leveraging the knowledge of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) without full fine-tuning. The key methodology involves using a frozen Qwen2-1.5B model as a "knowledge source" and a GPT-Neo-125M model as a "generation module," connected by Enhanced Cross-Attention layers that include linear projections, an adapter block, and a gating mechanism. Training on the Bespoke-Stratos-17k dataset for 15 epochs reduced training loss from 13.8 to 2.3 in the first epoch and to 1.1 in subsequent ones. For AI practitioners, the principal implication is that this modular approach can significantly reduce computational costs associated with training large language models while still achieving substantial performance improvements on specific tasks.  |

The main research objective is to develop a framework, CTRL, that trains a critic model to generate feedback that maximizes correction performance for a fixed generator model, without human supervision. The methodology uses a two-stage approach: supervised finetuning using execution feedback to synthesize critiques, followed by reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize the critic.

The main research objective was to develop and conduct statistical audits to detect prompt caching and determine the level of cache sharing (per-user, per-organization, or global) in real-world LLM API providers. The key methodology was using statistical hypothesis testing on response times from two procedures: one to generate cache hits, and one to generate cache misses, analyzing differences using the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The primary results revealed that prompt caching was detected in 8 out of 17 API providers, with 7 exhibiting global cache sharing across users, where it was detected with an average precision of around 0.8.

| Great Models Think Alike and this Undermines AI Oversight (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04313) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.04313))| AmeyaPrabhu, douwekiela, iaa01, Klingspor, shash42 | This paper studies how model similarity affects AI oversight, finding that greater similarity biases evaluations and reduces gains from training on Language Model (LM) annotations, with model errors becoming more correlated as capabilities increase. The main research question is how model similarity impacts the effectiveness of AI oversight, both in evaluation (LLM-as-a-judge) and training (using LM annotations). The key methodology involves proposing Chance Adjusted Probabilistic Agreement (CAPA), a new metric for LM similarity based on the overlap in model mistakes, and using it to analyze LLM-as-a-judge and training on LM annotation scenarios. Primary results show LLM-as-a-judge scores are significantly correlated with model similarity (average Pearson r=0.84), and gains from weak-to-strong generalization are higher when the supervisor and student models are more dissimilar. For AI practitioners, increasing model similarity poses a risk due to correlated failures, indicating a need for measuring and reporting model similarity and developing methods for training diverse models.  |

| On Teacher Hacking in Language Model Distillation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02671) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.02671))| Nino Vieillard, Sarah Perrin, Johan Ferret, Daniele Calandriello, Daniil Tiapkin | Language model distillation can exhibit "teacher hacking," where a student model exploits imperfections in the teacher instead of approximating the true data distribution. The main research question is whether teacher hacking occurs during knowledge distillation in language models, and if so, when and how it can be mitigated. A controlled experimental setup is used, involving an oracle (ground-truth) language model, a teacher model distilled from the oracle, and a student model distilled from the teacher. Results show that teacher hacking occurs when using a fixed offline dataset for distillation, observable when optimization deviates from polynomial convergence laws; for example KL divergence between student and teacher decreases, but divergence from Oracle increases. The implication for AI practioners is to utilize online data generation, prioritize prompt diversity, or increase generation budget to mitigate teacher hacking during language model distillation.  |

The main research question is how LLM performance on logical reasoning tasks scales with problem complexity. The key methodology involves generating logic grid puzzles with controllable complexity using constraint satisfaction problems and evaluating various LLMs' performance.

| Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding for Efficient LLM Reasoning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19324) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.19324))| doyensahoo, JunnanLi, hendrydong, yuhuixu, baohao | Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding (RSD) is introduced to improve the efficiency of large language model (LLM) inference, particularly for multi-step reasoning tasks. The main research question is how to balance efficiency and accuracy in LLM inference by integrating lightweight "draft" evaluations with reward-driven refinements from a more capable "target" model. The key methodology involves using a process reward model to evaluate intermediate decoding steps from a draft model and dynamically deciding whether to accept them or invoke the target model for correction based on reward thresholds. Primary results show that RSD achieves up to 4.4× fewer FLOPs compared to using the target model alone, while achieving up to 3.5 higher accuracy than standard speculative decoding on reasoning benchmarks. For AI practitioners, RSD provides a robust framework to deploy LLMs more efficiently in resource-intensive scenarios by optimizing the trade-off between computational cost and output quality.  |
| Self-supervised Quantized Representation for Seamlessly Integrating Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18119) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.18119))| Fangzhi Xu, Zhen Peng, Kai He, Tianzhe Zhao, Qika | The paper introduces a method for integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) using quantized representations. The main research question is how to effectively bridge the gap between KG structures and the natural language format of LLMs to achieve seamless integration.

The principal implication for AI practitioners is that they can leverage the SSQR method to seamlessly integrate KGs with LLMs by using the learned quantized codes as input features, enhancing model performance on KG-related tasks such as link prediction and triple classification without requiring significant architectural modifications.  |
| Constitutional Classifiers: Defending against Universal Jailbreaks across Thousands of Hours of Red Teaming (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18837) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.18837))| Primusa, euanong, sgoodfriend, jayelm, meg-tong | Constitutional Classifiers are synthetic safeguards that defend large language models (LLMs) against universal jailbreaks by using a constitution of natural language rules. The main research question is whether Constitutional Classifiers can effectively defend LLMs against universal jailbreak strategies that systematically bypass model safeguards and extract harmful information. The key methodology involves training classifiers on synthetic data generated by prompting LLMs with a constitution that specifies permitted and restricted content, followed by extensive red teaming to test robustness. The primary results show that in over 3,000 estimated hours of red teaming, no red teamer found a universal jailbreak that could extract information at a similar level of detail to an unguarded model across most target queries, and enhanced classifiers demonstrated robust defense against held-out domain-specific jailbreaks, with an absolute 0.38% increase in production-traffic refusals. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that Constitutional Classifiers offer a viable defense against universal jailbreaks while maintaining practical deployment feasibility, and thus can play a crucial role in safely deploying capable AI systems.  |
| Trading Inference-Time Compute for Adversarial Robustness (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18841) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.18841))| Sam Toyer, Stephanie Lin, Boaz Barak, Evgenia Nitishinskaya, Wojciech Zaremba | Here is a concise summary of the research paper:  This paper investigates the impact of increased inference-time computation on the adversarial robustness of reasoning models. The main research question is whether increasing inference-time compute can improve the robustness of large language models (LLMs) against adversarial attacks without adversarial training. The key methodology involves testing various adversarial attacks on OpenAI's reasoning models (01-preview and 01-mini) and measuring attack success rates as a function of inference-time compute. The primary results show that increased inference-time compute generally improves robustness across a range of attacks, with the attack success rate often decreasing to zero as test-time compute grows; for example, in a many-shot attack on a math task, increasing inference-time compute reduced the success rate of an adversary aiming to output the correct answer multiplied by 7 to near zero. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that scaling inference-time compute can be a viable strategy for enhancing the adversarial robustness of LLMs, offering a complementary approach to traditional adversarial training.  |

| Unraveling the Capabilities of Language Models in News Summarization (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18128) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.18128))| Göksel Biricik, odabashi | This research paper benchmarks 20 language models for news summarization across three datasets using zero-shot and few-shot learning. The main research question is how effectively smaller-scale language models handle news summarization compared to larger models, balancing efficiency and performance. The key methodology involves a multifaceted evaluation approach including automatic metrics (ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore), human evaluation, and AI-based evaluation using GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 as a judge. Primary results indicate that GPT-3.5-Turbo achieved the highest scores in automated metrics on the CNN/DM dataset in the zero-shot setting, with a ROUGE-L score of 0.2077, but including demonstration examples in the few-shot setting did not enhance the performance of the models, and in some cases, led to worse quality of the generated summaries. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that while large models like GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 dominate in news summarization tasks, smaller models such as Qwen1.5-7B, SOLAR-10.7B-Instruct-v1.0, Meta-Llama-3-8B and Zephyr-7B-Beta show promising results, offering competitive alternatives.  |

The main research question is whether a world model can be trained offline on pre-collected trajectories to support test-time behavior optimization and task-agnostic reasoning using only passive data. The key methodology involves using DINOv2 patch features to model visual dynamics without reconstructing the visual world, predicting future patch features from offline behavioral trajectories. The primary result is that DINO-WM achieves a 90% success rate on the Push-T task, compared to 4% for DreamerV3. For AI practitioners, DINO-WM demonstrates that pretrained visual features can be leveraged to create world models capable of zero-shot planning across diverse tasks without task-specific data, enabling more generalizable and efficient robot learning.  |

Wilson, xhb120633, louanna | Summary of the research paper is: The study investigates exploration capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in an open-ended task, revealing that most LLMs underperform compared to humans due to a tendency to make premature decisions. The main research question is whether LLMs can explore effectively in an open-ended task, comparable to humans. The key methodology involves using the game Little Alchemy 2 as a paradigm, applying regression models to analyze exploration strategies, and using Sparse Autoencoders (SAE) to probe latent representations of exploration-related values. The primary results show that o1 significantly outperformed humans (t = 9.71, p < 0.001), while other LLMs performed worse, with most models relying primarily on uncertainty-driven strategies. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that the current architecture of traditional LLMs may hinder effective exploration in open-ended tasks due to their tendency to process uncertainty and choices much earlier than empowerment values.  |

The main research question is whether SFT or RL leads to better generalization in foundation models when applied to unseen variants of learned tasks. The key methodology involves training language and vision-language models with SFT and RL on two tasks, GeneralPoints and V-IRL, and evaluating their performance on in-distribution and out-of-distribution variations of these tasks. The primary results show that RL, especially with an outcome-based reward, leads to better generalization than SFT across both tasks; for example, RL improves out-of-distribution performance on the V-IRL-L task by +11.0% (80.8% to 91.8%).

| Padding Tone: A Mechanistic Analysis of Padding Tokens in T2I Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06751) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.06751))| Yoad Tewel, Rinon Gal, Hadas Orgad, Ido Galil, Michael Toker | This paper investigates the role of padding tokens in text-to-image (T2I) models. The main research question is how padding tokens, typically used to standardize input prompt lengths, affect the image generation process in T2I models. The key methodology involves two causal intervention techniques, ITE and IDP, to analyze the impact of padding tokens on model components by selectively replacing prompt or padding tokens with "clean" pads and observing the changes in generated images. The primary results show that in models like LDM and LLaMA-UNet, padding tokens encode significant semantic information, achieving a CLIP score of 0.30 when only the first 20% of pad tokens are used, and contribute to image generation, whereas, in models with frozen text encoders, they are largely ignored.

In simulated "Stack in Order" tasks with severe disturbances, CaM achieved a 17.5% higher success rate than the DoReMi baseline.  This allows AI practitioners to build more robust and reliable closed-loop robotic systems capable of handling unexpected events and complex, long-horizon tasks.  |

The research aimed to develop a cross-platform autonomous GUI agent capable of performing complex tasks independently without relying on external closed-source models.  The key methodology involved a two-stage training pipeline using a Vision-Language Model (VLM): first for GUI grounding on a newly created template-augmented dataset, followed by planning and reasoning training on a VLM-augmented trajectory dataset.  AGUVIS-72B achieved a task success rate of 89.2% on ScreenSpot, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods in both offline and real-world online scenarios.  This indicates a significant advancement towards creating fully autonomous, vision-based GUI agents, offering AI practitioners a potentially more efficient and adaptable solution for automating interactions with diverse digital environments compared to text-based or LLM-dependent approaches.  |
| A Noise is Worth Diffusion Guidance (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03895) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2412.03895))| Minjae Kim, Sanghyun Lee, Jiwon Kang, Donghoon Ahn, Min-Jaewon | NoiseRefine improves text-to-image diffusion model quality without guidance methods like classifier-free guidance (CFG).  The research explores whether guidance can be replaced by refining initial noise in the diffusion pipeline. The authors train a noise refining model using multistep score distillation (MSD) to map standard Gaussian noise to a learned "guidance-free" noise space, derived from inverting guided high-quality images.  Refined noise achieved FID scores comparable to, and in some cases better than, CFG guidance. This method offers AI practitioners a faster and potentially higher-quality alternative to computationally expensive guidance methods for text-to-image diffusion models.  |

GPT-40 achieved the highest average Performance Gap Recovered (PGR) score of 46.8% in instance generation.  AI practitioners can utilize AGORABENCH to select appropriate LMs for synthetic data generation based on the specific task and available resources, considering that problem-solving ability does not directly correlate with data generation effectiveness.  |
| MV-Adapter: Multi-view Consistent Image Generation Made Easy (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03632) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2412.03632))| Ran Yi, Haoran Wang, pookiefoof, bennyguo, huanngzh | MV-Adapter is a plug-and-play adapter enabling pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to generate multi-view consistent images.  The objective is to efficiently generate multi-view consistent images while preserving the quality and knowledge of pre-trained T2I models, without full fine-tuning. The key methodology involves duplicating and parallelizing the self-attention layers of the base T2I model to create separate multi-view and image cross-attention layers within the adapter.  On camera-guided image-to-multiview generation on the GSO dataset, MV-Adapter achieved 22.131 PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) with SDXL. This allows AI practitioners to efficiently adapt existing high-quality T2I models for multi-view generation at high resolutions, reducing computational costs and mitigating overfitting risks associated with full model fine-tuning.  |

This was estimated using a two-step process:  first, fitting a Scaling Law to language modeling loss, and second, fitting a function to relate loss to downstream task performance.  Open-source base LLMs released since 2023 were evaluated against five benchmarks.  iv) **Primary results (include one specific quantitative finding):**  The maximum capacity density of LLMs doubles approximately every 3.3 months.  v) **Principal implication for AI practitioners:** The Densing Law suggests that achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art LLMs using significantly fewer parameters is possible within a timeframe of approximately three months, thereby emphasizing the importance of optimizing LLM capacity density for improved efficiency and reduced computational costs in future LLM development.  |

Florence-VL 8B achieved 89.9% on MMBench (EN) compared to 67.9% for LLaVA next 8B, demonstrating significant improvements across various benchmarks. This implies that AI practitioners can leverage generative vision models like Florence-2 and fusion techniques like DBFusion to build more robust and versatile MLLMs for tasks requiring detailed image understanding.  |

The research aimed to improve the scaling and visual detail representation of discrete generative models for text-to-image synthesis.  The core methodology involved a bitwise multi-scale visual tokenizer, an infinite-vocabulary classifier, and a bitwise self-correction mechanism within a visual autoregressive model. On the GenEval benchmark, Infinity achieved an overall score of 0.73, surpassing the SD3-Medium score of 0.62. This work suggests that scaling tokenizer vocabulary and incorporating bitwise modeling can significantly enhance autoregressive models for image generation, providing AI practitioners with a faster, more detailed, and potentially superior alternative to diffusion-based models.  |

The objective was to create a high-quality dataset aligned with human preferences for training and evaluating instruction-guided image editing models, addressing limitations of existing datasets like noisy instructions and low-resolution images.  The dataset was created through a four-stage pipeline involving annotator training, image selection, instruction and edited image generation using DALL-E 2, and a two-tiered human quality review process.  On the HumanEdit-core subset, the mask-free InstructPix2Pix model achieved a CLIP-I score of 0.8946, while the mask-provided Meissonic model achieved a CLIP-I score of 0.9348.  The paper presents quantitative results for multiple baselines across different editing types (add, remove, replace, etc.) but doesn't explicitly compare them or declare a "best" overall.  AI practitioners can use HumanEdit to train and benchmark instruction-based image editing models, especially for high-resolution, photorealistic editing tasks that better align with human expectations than previous datasets.  The availability of masks, along with a subset allowing mask-free editing, allows for more flexible and diverse model training and evaluation.  |

The objective is to categorize and analyze existing methods for adapting MLLMs to individual user preferences across various modalities (text, image, audio, etc.). The authors propose a taxonomy classifying personalization techniques based on instruction, alignment, generation, and fine-tuning across different MLLM applications like text/image generation, recommendation, and retrieval. While specific quantitative results are inconsistently reported across surveyed works, the paper notes ConCon-Chi dataset contains 4008 images and 20 concepts within 101 contexts for evaluating personalized vision-language tasks.  AI practitioners can use this taxonomy to understand the landscape of MLLM personalization techniques and identify suitable approaches for specific applications, though further research on standardized evaluation metrics and benchmark datasets is needed.  |

Adelani, Clémentine Fourrier, Angelika Romanou, Shivalika Singh | This paper investigates cultural and linguistic biases in the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark and proposes an improved multilingual version.  The research aims to understand how cultural biases in translated datasets influence the performance of multilingual language models and to improve the quality of these datasets.  A large-scale evaluation of state-of-the-art language models was conducted using subsets of questions annotated as either culturally sensitive or culturally agnostic, alongside an improved, 42-language translated MMLU dataset called Global-MMLU.  Analysis found that 28% of the English MMLU questions require culturally sensitive knowledge, with 86.5% of culturally sensitive questions focused on Western culture.  AI practitioners should use Global-MMLU and report performance on culturally sensitive and agnostic subsets separately to better understand model capabilities across diverse cultures and languages, and to avoid inadvertently setting multilingual evaluation standards aligned with a single cultural paradigm.  |

On a multi-garment evaluation, AnyDressing achieves a CLIP-T score of 0.296, demonstrating improved text consistency. This provides AI practitioners with a more robust and controllable approach for generating virtual dressing images, enabling diverse combinations of attire and improved adherence to user-specified text prompts.  |

The research explores whether self-supervised learning methods can effectively learn 3D representations from synthetic shapes created via procedural programs and how these compare to representations learned from real-world 3D models. The study uses Point-MAE, a masked autoencoding framework, to train on a synthetic dataset of 150K procedurally generated 3D point clouds and compares performance with Point-MAE trained on ShapeNet.  On ScanObjectNN's PB-T50-RS benchmark, Point-MAE trained on synthetic shapes achieves 85.46% accuracy, compared to 85.18% for Point-MAE trained on ShapeNet. This suggests that procedurally generated data can be a viable alternative to real-world datasets for self-supervised 3D representation learning, potentially mitigating challenges related to data acquisition and copyright for AI practitioners working with 3D data.  |

| Predicting Emergent Capabilities by Finetuning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16035) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.16035))| Sergey Levine, Dan Klein, Eric Wallace, sea-snell | This paper investigates predicting the emergence of capabilities in large language models (LLMs).  The research asks: can few-shot emergent capabilities in future, larger LLMs be predicted by finetuning current, smaller LLMs?  The core methodology involves finetuning smaller LLMs with varying amounts of data, fitting a parametric "emergence law" to model how the point of emergence shifts with data, and extrapolating this law to the few-shot setting.  On MMLU, the method predicts emergence using models trained with ~10²² FLOPS, while the smallest post-emergence model required ~5 * 10²² FLOPS, enabling prediction 4-5x in advance in terms of FLOPS. This allows AI practitioners to potentially assess the future capabilities and emergent behavior of larger LLMs before they are trained, informing architectural choices and resource allocation.  |

This demonstrates the potential of using LLMs for efficient cross-architecture assembly transpilation, offering AI practitioners a new approach to code portability across diverse hardware ISAs without reliance on dynamic binary translation or emulation.  |
| Best of Both Worlds: Advantages of Hybrid Graph Sequence Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15671) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.15671))| Bryan Perozzi, Clayton Sanford, Mahdi Karami, Ali Parviz, Ali Behrouz | This paper investigates the strengths and weaknesses of different sequence models for graph-structured data.  The research aims to determine which sequence models and tokenization strategies are most effective for various graph tasks.  The authors introduce a unifying framework, Graph Sequence Model (GSM), and analyze sequence model performance on tasks including counting, connectivity, and shortest path. Results show no single sequence model or tokenizer consistently outperforms others across all tasks; for instance, a hybrid model combining Mamba and Transformer layers improved performance in most cases.  This suggests AI practitioners should carefully select tokenization and sequence models based on the specific graph task, considering factors like local vs. global information needs and node ordering.  |

| Large Multi-modal Models Can Interpret Features in Large Multi-modal Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14982) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.14982))| Ziwei Liu, Bo Li, Yifei Shen, Kaichen Zhang | This paper presents a framework for interpreting and steering the internal representations of large multimodal models (LMMs).  The research aims to understand the internal neural representations of LMMs, particularly how they encode semantic information. The key methodology involves training a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) on LLaVA-NeXT data integrated into a specific LMM layer and interpreting learned features using a larger LMM (LLaVA-OV-72B) in a zero-shot manner.  Results show the SAE features can steer LMM behavior, with some features exhibiting IOU scores above 0.5 with ground truth segmentation masks based on automatically generated explanations.  This framework allows AI practitioners to better understand and potentially control the behavior of LMMs, including mitigating hallucinations and prompting desired outputs by manipulating specific internal features.  |

The research aimed to address the scarcity of high-quality, large-scale datasets for video reasoning tasks.  The key methodology involved a semantic-aware pipeline to construct a VideoQA dataset with multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations, coupled with a Hybrid LVLMs Collaboration framework for reasoning.  The proposed method outperformed existing baselines on 12 out of 14 video reasoning tasks, achieving 34.1% average accuracy, surpassing the top open-source model (InternVL2) by 5.4% and the closed-source model (GPT-40) by 7.7%.

| Efficient Long Video Tokenization via Coordinated-based Patch Reconstruction (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14762) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.14762))| Pieter Abbeel, Jinwoo Shin, Sihyun Yu, Huiwon Jang, younggyoseo | CoordTok, a novel video tokenizer, efficiently encodes long videos into a compact set of tokens by reconstructing patches based on sampled coordinates.  The research aimed to develop a more efficient video tokenizer that leverages temporal coherence and scales to long video clips.  The key methodology involved encoding videos into factorized triplane representations and training a decoder to reconstruct patches corresponding to randomly sampled (x,y,t) coordinates.  CoordTok encodes a 128-frame, 128x128 resolution video into 1280 tokens, achieving similar reconstruction quality as baselines requiring 6144 or 8192 tokens.  This efficient tokenization enables AI practitioners to train memory-intensive video generation models, like diffusion transformers, on significantly longer video sequences than previously feasible.  |
| Novel View Extrapolation with Video Diffusion Priors (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14208) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.14208))| Shijian Lu, Ling Shao, KunhaoLiu | ViewExtrapolator leverages stable video diffusion (SVD) to refine artifact-prone novel views rendered by radiance fields or point clouds, enabling novel view extrapolation beyond training views. The research aims to improve novel view extrapolation, where synthesized views are far outside the range of training views, which is a weakness of current radiance field methods. The key methodology involves rendering a video transitioning from a training view to the extrapolated view, then refining it with SVD by modifying its denoising process and using guidance and resampling annealing. On the LLFF-Extra dataset, ViewExtrapolator achieves a 0.378 LPIPS score compared to 0.429 for the baseline DRGS method.  The paper does not specify if tuning SVD was required and if results improved further by fine-tuning SVD model. AI practitioners can utilize ViewExtrapolator as a post-processing method to significantly improve the visual quality of novel view extrapolations generated from existing 3D rendering techniques like radiance fields or point clouds. It should be noted that performance degrades with dynamic videos and extreme novel view angles.  |

Wang, Bang Gong, Jiaye Wu, Luchao Qi | MyTimeMachine (MyTM) personalizes facial age transformation using a few subject-specific images and a global aging prior.  The research aimed to develop a personalized age transformation method that accurately reflects an individual's appearance at a target age.  MyTM leverages a novel Adapter Network trained on a personal photo collection (~50 images) to modify the latent features of a global age transformation network (SAM). In age regression evaluations, MyTM achieved an 11.7% improvement in identity preservation (IDsim = 0.67) compared to the best-performing baseline (FADING).  AI practitioners can use MyTM to generate more accurate and personalized age-transformed faces, crucial for applications like visual effects in film or age progression for forensic investigations.  |

The research aims to evaluate LLMs' and VLMs' long-horizon reasoning and decision-making capabilities in dynamic settings.  The benchmark uses six reinforcement learning environments: BabyAI, Crafter, TextWorld, Baba Is AI, MiniHack, and NetHack, with varying complexities and textual and visual observation modalities.  GPT-4 achieved the highest average progression across all environments in the language-only setting at 32.34%. The significant performance gap between simpler and more complex games, as well as the drop in performance when using visual observations, highlights the need for AI practitioners to focus on improving VLMs' vision-based decision-making and LLMs' long-horizon planning abilities for more effective agent development.  |

| Enhancing the Reasoning Ability of Multimodal Large Language Models via Mixed Preference Optimization (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10442) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.10442))| Yangzhou Liu, Yue Cao, Wenhai Wang, Zhe Chen, Weiyun Wang | This paper introduces Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO) to improve multimodal reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs).  The research aims to address the limited multimodal reasoning capabilities and distribution shift issues observed in open-source Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.  The authors develop MPO, combining supervised fine-tuning loss with preference, quality, and generation losses, and create MMPR, a large-scale multimodal reasoning preference dataset, using automated pipelines.  InternVL2-8B-MPO, trained with MPO, achieves 67.0% accuracy on MathVista, an 8.7 point improvement over the baseline InternVL2-8B and comparable to the much larger InternVL2-76B. This suggests that MPO and MMPR can significantly improve the reasoning performance of smaller MLLMs, offering a potential pathway for developing more efficient and capable models for AI practitioners.  |

This indicates that combining CoT, MCTS, and reflection mechanisms can significantly improve the reasoning abilities of LLMs, offering AI practitioners new techniques for developing models capable of tackling complex, open-ended problems.  |
| OpenScholar: Synthesizing Scientific Literature with Retrieval-augmented LMs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14199) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.14199))| Amanpreet Singh, Weijia Shi, Rulin Shao, jacquelinehe, akariasai | OpenScholar is a retrieval-augmented language model for synthesizing scientific literature.  The research investigated whether large language models can effectively assist scientists in synthesizing the growing body of scientific literature.  The study developed OpenScholar, a specialized retrieval-augmented LM that synthesizes citation-backed responses by retrieving from a datastore of 45 million open-access papers and iteratively refining outputs using self-feedback.  OpenScholar-8B outperformed GPT-40 by 5% and PaperQA2 by 7% in correctness on the ScholarQABench benchmark.

| Multimodal Autoregressive Pre-training of Large Vision Encoders (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14402) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.14402))| Michal Klein, Philipp Dufter, Xiujun Li, Mustafa Shukor, efini | AIMv2, a family of vision encoders, is pre-trained using a multimodal autoregressive objective.  The research aims to develop a scalable and effective pre-training method for vision encoders that generalizes well to diverse downstream tasks.  The method involves training a vision transformer encoder with a causal multimodal decoder that autoregressively generates image patches and text tokens from a unified multimodal sequence of image and text embeddings.  The AIMv2-3B model achieved 89.5% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k with a frozen trunk after high-resolution fine-tuning.  This offers AI practitioners a straightforward, scalable, and high-performing vision encoder for various vision and multimodal applications, including zero-shot image recognition and multimodal instruction tuning.  |
| Ultra-Sparse Memory Network (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12364) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.12364))| Defa Zhu, Qiyang Min, Taoer, xyzed, FetchFortune | UltraMem, a novel architecture employing large-scale, ultra-sparse memory layers, aims to improve inference efficiency in large language models.  The research sought to reduce inference latency while maintaining or exceeding the performance of Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, addressing MoE's high memory access costs. The key methodology involves using Tucker decomposition for query-key retrieval within a memory layer and implicit value expansion to reduce memory access during training.  Experiments show UltraMem achieves up to 6x faster inference than MoE with the same parameter count and computational cost at a batch size of 64. This allows AI practitioners to deploy larger language models with improved inference speed in resource-constrained environments and potentially improve scaling properties for even larger models.  |
| Hymba: A Hybrid-head Architecture for Small Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13676) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.13676))| Zijia Chen, Wonmin Byeon, Shizhe Diao, Yonggan Fu, Xin Dong | Hymba, a family of small language models (SLMs), integrates transformer attention and state space models (SSMs) within a hybrid-head parallel architecture for enhanced efficiency and performance.  The research aimed to develop more efficient and performant SLMs by combining the strengths of attention mechanisms and SSMs while mitigating their individual weaknesses.  The key methodology involved fusing attention and SSM heads in parallel within the same layer, incorporating learnable meta tokens, optimizing KV cache usage, and scaling model size and training data.  Hymba-1.5B outperforms Llama-3.2-3B (a 3B parameter model) by 1.32% on average accuracy across commonsense reasoning tasks, while requiring an 11.67× smaller cache size and achieving 3.49× higher throughput. This result signifies that AI practitioners can achieve comparable or better performance with significantly smaller and more efficient SLMs using hybrid architectures like Hymba, potentially enabling broader deployment on resource-constrained devices.  |
| Natural Language Reinforcement Learning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14251) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.14251))| Mengyue Yang, Haotian Fu, Ziyu Wan, Xidong Feng, Benjamin-eecs | This paper introduces Natural Language Reinforcement Learning (NLRL), a novel RL paradigm that uses natural language to represent core RL components.  The objective is to improve reinforcement learning efficiency, stability, and interpretability by leveraging natural language and large language models (LLMs).  The core methodology involves redefining RL principles (objectives, policy, value function, Bellman equation) as language-based constructs and implementing them with LLMs via prompting and gradient-based training.  In Tic-Tac-Toe experiments, NLRL achieved higher win rates against baseline models, including a traditional PPO agent, reaching a win rate of 0.9.  NLRL offers AI practitioners a new framework for building more interpretable and potentially more efficient RL agents by integrating the strengths of large language models into the reinforcement learning process, although the paper's empirical evaluation focuses on relatively simple environments.  |
| Insight-V: Exploring Long-Chain Visual Reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14432) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.14432))| Winston Hu, Jingkang Yang, Hai-Long Sun, Zuyan, THUdyh | Insight-V is a system for enhancing visual reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).  The research aimed to improve long-chain visual reasoning in MLLMs, addressing the lack of robust datasets and training strategies.  A two-step pipeline generated structured reasoning data: a progressive strategy created diverse reasoning paths, and multi-granularity assessment ensured data quality; a multi-agent system, consisting of reasoning and summarization agents, was trained using supervised fine-tuning and iterative Direct Preference Optimization.  Insight-V improved the performance of LLaVA-NeXT by an average of 7.0% across seven visual reasoning benchmarks.  This suggests AI practitioners can significantly enhance MLLM visual reasoning capabilities by using specialized data generation pipelines and multi-agent system architectures with iterative DPO training.  |
| Stable Flow: Vital Layers for Training-Free Image Editing (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14430) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.14430))| Kfir Aberman, Egor Nemchinov, Ohad Fried, Or Patashnik, omriav | Stable Flow leverages the reduced diversity of flow-based diffusion models for consistent, training-free image editing.  The research aimed to identify crucial layers in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models for effective image editing without retraining. The methodology involved systematically bypassing individual DiT layers during image generation and measuring the perceptual impact using DINOv2, identifying "vital layers" essential for image formation.  Injecting features from a source image into the vital layers of the edited image's generation trajectory resulted in a CLIP image-text direction similarity score of 0.14, higher than other compared methods.  This allows AI practitioners to perform various image edits, including non-rigid transformations and object manipulation, using a single, training-free mechanism by targeting these vital layers in flow-based DiT models.  |
| UnifiedCrawl: Aggregated Common Crawl for Affordable Adaptation of LLMs on Low-Resource Languages (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14343) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.14343))| Tae-Sun Chung, Akhil Kedia, Bethel Melesse Tessema | UnifiedCrawl improves Large Language Model (LLM) performance on low-resource languages using consumer-grade hardware. The research aimed to improve LLM performance in low-resource languages given data scarcity and limited compute resources. The authors developed UnifiedCrawl, a method to efficiently extract monolingual data from the Common Crawl corpus, and fine-tuned multilingual LLMs using quantization and low-rank adapters (QLoRA). Fine-tuning a 4.5B parameter XGLM model with UnifiedCrawl-Amharic data using QLoRA resulted in a 45% perplexity reduction from 35.6 to 19.6 compared to the original XGLM model. This demonstrates that using UnifiedCrawl and QLoRA allows practitioners to adapt large, pre-trained multilingual LLMs for low-resource languages using readily available hardware, promoting wider accessibility and affordability.  |
| MagicDriveDiT: High-Resolution Long Video Generation for Autonomous Driving with Adaptive Control (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13807) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.13807))| Zhenguo Li, Lanqing Hong, Bo Xiao, Kai Chen, Ruiyuan Gao | MagicDriveDiT generates high-resolution, long street-view videos for autonomous driving applications with precise control. The objective is to synthesize realistic and controllable high-resolution, long street-view videos suitable for autonomous driving applications. The paper uses a DiT-based diffusion model with flow matching, spatial-temporal conditional encoding, and a progressive bootstrapping training strategy incorporating variable video lengths and resolutions.   MagicDriveDiT achieves a Frechet Video Distance (FVD) score of 94.84, significantly lower than baseline models, on the nuScenes dataset. AI practitioners working with autonomous driving systems can leverage MagicDriveDiT to create high-quality, controllable synthetic video datasets for training and testing perception models, potentially reducing reliance on real-world data collection.  |
| Do I Know This Entity? Knowledge Awareness and Hallucinations in Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14257) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.14257))| Neel Nanda, Senthooran Rajamanoharan, Oscar Obeso, Javier Ferrando | This paper investigates the mechanisms behind hallucinations in large language models, specifically focusing on entity recognition. The research aims to understand how language models determine whether they possess knowledge about a given entity and how this relates to hallucination. The researchers use sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify directions in the representation space of the model that correlate with known and unknown entities. They find that manipulating these "entity recognition" directions can causally influence the model's refusal to answer or its tendency to hallucinate, achieving nearly 100% refusal for unknown entities when steering with the discovered latent direction. Steering with unknown entity latents disrupts the factual recall mechanism by reducing attention paid to entity tokens by downstream attention heads. This finding suggests that AI practitioners can potentially leverage and manipulate these latent directions to control hallucination and refusal behaviors in language models, directly impacting the reliability and factuality of generated text.  |
| Patience Is The Key to Large Language Model Reasoning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13082) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.13082))| Yijiong Yu | This paper proposes a method to improve large language model reasoning by encouraging more detailed reasoning processes.  The research aims to enhance complex problem-solving in LLMs without requiring extensive, costly training data.  The key methodology involves using preference optimization (DPO) to train a model to favor detailed reasoning processes (positive examples) over concise answers (negative examples).  Results demonstrate a 6.7% improvement on the GSM8k benchmark.  This suggests AI practitioners can significantly improve LLM performance on complex tasks by training for more patient and thorough reasoning, even with limited data, though at the cost of increased inference time.  |

| Is Your LLM Secretly a World Model of the Internet? Model-Based Planning for Web Agents (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06559) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.06559))| Cheng Chang, Kai Zhang, Boyu Gou, Boyuan Zheng, Yu Gu | WEB-DREAMER uses LLMs as world models for planning in web navigation.  The research investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can function as effective world models for web navigation, addressing safety and complexity challenges.  The study uses a model-based planning approach where an LLM simulates potential action outcomes in natural language and selects the highest-scoring action.  On VisualWebArena, WEB-DREAMER achieved a 23.6% success rate, a 33.3% relative improvement over the reactive baseline.  This suggests that incorporating LLM-based world models enables safer and more efficient planning for web agents compared to reactive agents and potentially opens new possibilities for online planning in place of less scalable tree search methods.  |
| SAMURAI: Adapting Segment Anything Model for Zero-Shot Visual Tracking with Motion-Aware Memory (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11922) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.11922))| Jenq-Neng Hwang, Hsiang-Wei Huang, Cheng-Yen Yang, Nitre, wchai | SAMURAI enhances the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) for zero-shot visual object tracking.  The research aims to improve SAM 2's visual object tracking performance, particularly in crowded scenes and during occlusions, without retraining or fine-tuning.  The key methodology involves integrating motion information via a Kalman Filter and a motion-aware memory selection mechanism to improve mask selection and memory management within the SAM 2 architecture.  SAMURAI achieves a 7.1% AUC gain on the LaSOText dataset and a 3.5% AO gain on GOT-10k compared to the baseline SAM2.1.  This improvement offers AI practitioners a more robust and accurate real-time, zero-shot visual tracking method readily adaptable across various datasets and potentially other tracking frameworks.  |
| Stylecodes: Encoding Stylistic Information For Image Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12811) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.12811))| CiaraRowles | Stylecodes encodes image styles into compact strings for style-conditioned image generation.  The research aimed to develop an open-source method for controlling the style of diffusion-based image generation, enabling easy sharing and collaboration.  The authors developed Stylecodes, a system combining an attention-based autoencoder and a ControlNet-style UNet decoder to encode image style as a 20-digit base64 code and condition a frozen Stable Diffusion 1.5 model.  Experiments showed that Stylecodes effectively enforces the encoded style, allowing generation of images matching the style of a source image given different text prompts; the dataset size was 35,000 image-style-prompt entries.  AI practitioners can use Stylecodes for easily shareable and collaborative style control in image generation, though the paper does not specify the quality of style transfer compared to other methods nor specify metrics for evaluation.  The training cost for the control model was a limitation, especially for larger diffusion models.  |
| When Precision Meets Position: BFloat16 Breaks Down RoPE in Long-Context Training (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13476) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.13476))| Cunxiao Du, Tongyao Zhu, Chao Du, Qian Liu, haonan3 | This paper investigates the impact of BFloat16 precision on Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) in long-context language model training.  The authors aim to determine if BFloat16 precision degrades the relative positional encoding properties of RoPE and how this affects long-context performance.  They introduce AnchorAttention, a modified attention mechanism that treats the first token as a shared anchor with a fixed position ID, and compare its performance to full attention and intra-document attention. Results on the RULER benchmark show AnchorAttention significantly improves long-context performance, exceeding full attention by 17.47 percentage points on the LLAMA-2-7B model with 128K context window. AI practitioners training LLMs with long contexts should consider using AnchorAttention with BFloat16 to improve performance and reduce training time.  |
| ORID: Organ-Regional Information Driven Framework for Radiology Report Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13025) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.13025))| Dongnan Liu, Ziyong Feng, Xiang An, Tiancheng Gu, Kaichengalex | The paper introduces ORID, a framework for generating radiology reports from X-ray images by leveraging organ-regional information.  The objective is to improve the accuracy and believability of automated radiology report generation.  ORID uses a LLaVA-Med-RRG model fine-tuned on an organ-level instruction dataset, an organ-based cross-modal fusion module, and an organ importance coefficient analysis module based on a graph neural network. On the IU-Xray dataset, ORID achieved a BLEU@1 score of 0.501, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. This implies that AI practitioners working on medical report generation can leverage organ-specific information and cross-modal fusion techniques to enhance the precision and clinical relevance of generated reports.  |

| Continuous Speculative Decoding for Autoregressive Image Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11925) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.11925))| Fei Li, Qi Yang, Kun Ding, Robert Zhang, MarkWang | This paper introduces Continuous Speculative Decoding (CSpD), a novel method for accelerating autoregressive image generation.  The objective is to reduce the computational overhead of continuous-valued autoregressive image generation models while maintaining output quality. CSpD adapts the speculative decoding algorithm from discrete to continuous token space by using denoising trajectory alignment, token pre-filling, and acceptance-rejection sampling to address inconsistencies between draft and target models.  Experiments on MAR models for ImageNet 256x256 generation demonstrated a speedup of up to 2.33x.  This provides AI practitioners with a technique to significantly accelerate inference for continuous autoregressive image generation models without requiring model retraining or architectural changes, enabling faster generation with comparable quality.  |
| Soft Robotic Dynamic In-Hand Pen Spinning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12734) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.12734))| Jeffrey Ichnowski, Christopher G. Atkeson, Jean Oh, Uksang Yoo, Yunchao Yao | SWIFT is a system for learning dynamic in-hand manipulation tasks with soft robotic hands, using pen spinning as a case study.  The research aimed to enable a soft robotic hand to autonomously learn to grasp and dynamically spin a pen using only real-world data.  A self-supervised, trial-and-error approach employing Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) optimized grasp location and servo parameters for a three-fingered soft hand. After optimization, SWIFT achieved a 100% success rate across three pens with different weight distributions. This demonstrates the potential for soft robots to perform complex dynamic manipulation tasks without precise object models or simulated training, which can inform the development of more robust and adaptable real-world robotic manipulation systems.  |
| RedPajama: an Open Dataset for Training Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12372) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.12372))| Shane Adams, Yonatan Oren, Quentin Anthony, Daniel Fu, Maurice Weber | RedPajama releases two datasets, V1 and V2, aiming to address transparency and data access challenges in large language model training.  The research aimed to create open and versatile datasets for training and analyzing LLMs, specifically focusing on data composition and filtering strategies.

This allows practitioners to leverage the RedPajama datasets and associated quality signals to curate and experiment with data subsets for training large language models, fostering development of more transparent and potentially higher-performing LLMs.  |
| Building Trust: Foundations of Security, Safety and Transparency in AI (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12275) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.12275))| Huamin Chen, Mark Bestavros, Emily Fox, Garth Mollett, huzaifas-sidhpurwala | The paper explores security and safety implications of publicly available AI models.  The objective is to propose strategies for enhancing security, safety, and transparency in the development and operation of public AI models. The paper reviews current security and safety scenarios, highlighting challenges like a lack of standardized processes for lifecycle management and vulnerability remediation.

A primary implication for AI practitioners is the need to adopt a holistic approach to AI risk management, encompassing both security (protecting systems from threats) and safety (preventing unintended harm from model operation), possibly through the creation of frameworks such as a "Hazards Exposure eXchange (HEX)" format and an "Adjunct panel" mirroring similar concepts used in traditional software security.  The paper lacks precise details about the proposed HEX format and Adjunct panel, hindering full comprehension of their function.  |
| Evaluating Tokenizer Performance of Large Language Models Across Official Indian Languages (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12240) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.12240))| D. J. Bora, tamang0000 | This paper evaluates the tokenization performance of various large language models (LLMs) across 22 official Indian languages.  The research aimed to compare the efficiency of different tokenizers used by 12 LLMs in processing these languages.

| Drowning in Documents: Consequences of Scaling Reranker Inference (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11767) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.11767))| Michael Carbin, Matei Zaharia, Erik Lindgren, Mathew Jacob, mrdrozdov | This paper investigates the impact of scaling the number of reranked documents on retrieval quality.  The research questions how the performance of state-of-the-art rerankers changes when scoring progressively more documents, including the entire dataset.  The authors evaluate open and closed-source rerankers on eight academic and enterprise information retrieval benchmarks, measuring Recall@10 and Recall@100 at various reranking depths (K).  Results show Recall@10 drops dramatically for many rerankers as K increases beyond 100, often falling below the performance of standalone retrievers; for example, average Recall@10 across enterprise datasets using voyage-rerank-lite-1 decreased from 0.7 to roughly 0.2 as K increased from 100 to 5000.  AI practitioners should carefully consider the number of documents (K) provided to rerankers as excessively large K can significantly degrade performance, and listwise reranking with LLMs may offer increased robustness.  |
| Comprehensive and Practical Evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems for Medical Question Answering (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09213) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.09213))| Thien Huu Nguyen, Chien Van Nguyen, Nghia Trung Ngo, Franck-Dernoncourt | This paper introduces MedRGB, a benchmark for evaluating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems in medical question answering. The research aimed to assess the performance of RAG systems in practical medical scenarios, including handling noise, integrating multiple information sources, and resisting factual errors.  The methodology involved creating multiple test scenarios (standard RAG, sufficiency, integration, and robustness) and evaluating state-of-the-art and open-source LLMs across these scenarios using four medical QA datasets supplemented with noise and adversarial information. Results revealed that Llama-3-70b achieved the highest noise detection accuracy in the sufficiency test, but all models struggled with factual error detection in the robustness test, with GPT-3.5 having the highest detection rate despite the lowest performance. The key implication for AI practitioners is the need for specialized modules and improved model robustness beyond target accuracy when developing reliable medical RAG systems, as current models have limited ability to handle noise and misinformation within retrieved content.   |
| SlimLM: An Efficient Small Language Model for On-Device Document Assistance (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09944) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.09944))| Viet Dac Lai, Seunghyun Yoon, Phat T. Nguyen, Thang M. Pham, Franck-Dernoncourt | SlimLM models are optimized for on-device document assistance tasks. The research aimed to develop efficient small language models (SLMs) for document processing on mobile devices, addressing the trade-off between model size, performance, and resource constraints.  The key methodology involved pre-training SlimLM models (ranging from 125M to 1B parameters) on the SlimPajama-627B dataset and fine-tuning them on DocAssist, a specialized dataset for summarization, question suggestion, and question answering.  SlimLM-1B achieved a ROUGE-L score of 0.48, approaching the performance of the larger Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct model. The primary implication for AI practitioners is the ability to deploy performant document processing capabilities directly on mobile devices, potentially reducing server costs and enhancing user privacy.  |
| SmoothCache: A Universal Inference Acceleration Technique for Diffusion Transformers (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10510) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.10510))| Haomiao Jiang, Joshua Geddes, mnandwana, helloterran, josephliu-roblox | SmoothCache is a model-agnostic inference acceleration technique for Diffusion Transformers (DiT).  The research aimed to develop a universal caching scheme to speed up DiT inference across various modalities without compromising generation quality. The methodology involved leveraging layer-wise representation errors from a small calibration set to adaptively cache and reuse key features during inference.  Experiments showed up to a 71% speedup while maintaining or improving generation quality on models like DiT-XL, Open-Sora, and Stable Audio Open. This technique offers AI practitioners a simple, training-free method to significantly reduce DiT inference latency, potentially enabling real-time applications.  |
| Top-$nσ$: Not All Logits Are You Need (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07641) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.07641))| Liusheng Huang, Hongli Xu, Jianchun Liu, tomorrowdawn | Top-ησ, a novel sampling method for large language models (LLMs), operates directly on pre-softmax logits by leveraging a statistical threshold.  The research aims to improve LLM reasoning task performance by developing a sampling method that filters irrelevant tokens more effectively than existing approaches.  The key methodology involves separating logits into noisy and informative regions based on their statistical properties, specifically by capturing a region extending *n* standard deviations (σ) below the maximum logit value.  On the GSM8K dataset, top-ησ achieves 74.61% accuracy at a temperature of 3.0, while other comparable sampling methods fail completely. AI practitioners can utilize top-ησ to potentially improve the performance and stability of LLMs in reasoning tasks, especially at higher temperatures, where traditional sampling methods often degrade.  The paper mentions an incomplete preprint version, stating some experimental results and appendices will be added later.  |
| StableV2V: Stablizing Shape Consistency in Video-to-Video Editing (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11045) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.11045))| Dong Liu, Yunwei Lan, Kaidong Zhang, Rui Li, Chang Liu | StableV2V is a novel video editing method that aims to maintain shape consistency between user prompts and edited video content.  The paper addresses the problem of existing video editing methods often producing results inconsistent with user-desired shapes, especially when prompts introduce significant shape changes.  The key methodology involves a three-stage pipeline: a prompted first-frame editor, an iterative shape aligner (ISA) that simulates and refines the depth map of edited frames based on source video motion, and a conditional image-to-video generator that propagates edited content.  On the DAVIS-EDIT benchmark, StableV2V achieves a DOVER score of 67.78/70.80 for text-based editing, outperforming comparable methods.  This implies that AI practitioners can leverage StableV2V's shape-consistent editing approach to develop more robust and user-intuitive video editing tools, particularly for tasks involving significant shape transformations.  |
| LLäMmlein: Compact and Competitive German-Only Language Models from Scratch (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11171) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.11171))| Andreas Hotho, Julia Wunderle, Jan Pfister | This paper introduces LLäMmlein, two German-only decoder-only LLMs (120M and 1B parameters) trained from scratch.  The objective was to create high-performing, transparent German language models and address the performance gap of existing German LLMs compared to English models.  The methodology involved preprocessing a filtered RedPajama V2 dataset, training a custom German tokenizer, and pretraining the models using a TinyLlama framework.  LLäMmlein 1B achieved state-of-the-art performance on the EuroParl token classification task within the SuperGLEBer benchmark with a score of 0.732.  The open-sourcing of the models, code, and data provides AI practitioners with resources for further German NLP research, including domain adaptation and the creation of a dedicated German instruction dataset.  |
| Awaker2.5-VL: Stably Scaling MLLMs with Parameter-Efficient Mixture of Experts (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10669) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.10669))| Nanyi Fei, Hongpeng Lin, Guoxing Yang, Yanqi Dai, Jinqiang Long | Awaker2.5-VL is a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture designed to address the "multi-task conflict" issue in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).  The research aimed to improve MLLM performance on diverse tasks by mitigating interference between different data distributions and representations.  The key methodology involves a sparsely activated MoE structure with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts and a simplified routing strategy based on instruction embeddings. On the MME-Realworld-CN benchmark, Awaker2.5-VL achieved an overall score of 62.7, surpassing all other compared models.  This indicates that incorporating MoE with LoRA and a stable routing strategy can be an effective approach for scaling MLLMs and improving performance across diverse multimodal tasks, offering a potential solution to the multi-task conflict issue.  |
| FitDiT: Advancing the Authentic Garment Details for High-fidelity Virtual Try-on (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10499) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.10499))| Chengming Xu, Qingdong He, Donghao Luo, Xiaobin Hu, Boyuan Jiang | FitDiT is a novel Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based model for high-fidelity image-based virtual try-on.  The research aims to address the challenges of preserving rich texture details and achieving accurate size-aware fitting in virtual try-on applications.

This improvement in texture fidelity using the DiT architecture provides AI practitioners developing virtual try-on applications with a more effective model for generating realistic and detailed synthesized images of people wearing clothes.  |
| Adaptive Decoding via Latent Preference Optimization (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09661) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.09661))| Jason Weston, Asli Celikyilmaz, Ping Yu, Ilia Kulikov, Shehzaad Dhuliawala | This paper introduces Adaptive Decoding, a method for dynamically adjusting the sampling temperature of large language models (LLMs) during text generation.  The research aims to address the suboptimality of fixed temperature decoding for tasks requiring varying levels of creativity and factual accuracy.  The core methodology involves adding an ADAPTIVEDECODER module to the LLM, trained using Latent Preference Optimization (LPO) to learn optimal temperature values for different prompts or tokens.  Results on the UltraMathStories dataset, a combination of math, creative writing, and general instruction-following tasks, show that Adaptive Decoding outperforms all fixed temperature decoding strategies.  This implies that AI practitioners can leverage Adaptive Decoding to improve LLM performance on diverse tasks without manual temperature tuning, automating the balance between creative and factual generation.  |

LLaVA-01 outperformed the base Llama model by 6.9% on average across six multimodal reasoning benchmarks and surpassed some larger, closed-source models.  This indicates that training with structured reasoning data and employing stage-level beam search can significantly improve the performance and scalability of VLMs for reasoning-intensive tasks.  |
| GaussianAnything: Interactive Point Cloud Latent Diffusion for 3D Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08033) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.08033))| doubling, hongfz16, ZhaoyangLyu, sczhou, yslan | GaussianAnything introduces a novel framework for 3D generation using a point cloud-structured latent space and cascaded diffusion.

The method employs a 3D VAE encoding multi-view posed RGB-D-N renderings into a point cloud-structured latent space, followed by cascaded latent diffusion modeling using DiT and flow matching. On the Objaverse dataset, GaussianAnything achieved a Minimum Matching Distance (MMD) of 15.48%, outperforming other image-conditioned methods. The proposed point cloud-structured latent space enables geometry-texture disentanglement and interactive 3D editing, offering AI practitioners a new approach for controllable 3D content creation.  |
| The Dawn of GUI Agent: A Preliminary Case Study with Claude 3.5 Computer Use (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10323) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.10323))| Mingyu Ouyang, AnalMom, QuStar, SiyuanH | This paper presents a preliminary case study of Claude 3.5 Computer Use, a new API-based GUI agent.

| MagicQuill: An Intelligent Interactive Image Editing System (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09703) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.09703))| Qiuyu Wang, Hao Ouyang, wwen1997, bruceyyu, LiuZichen | MagicQuill is an interactive image editing system built upon diffusion models that allows users to make edits using brushstrokes, which are interpreted by a multimodal large language model (MLLM).  The research aimed to develop a robust, open-source, interactive, and precise image editing system that simplifies the process of making detailed image edits.  The system combines a dual-branch Editing Processor (inpainting and control branches) with a Painting Assistor (MLLM for prompt prediction) and an Idea Collector (user interface for brushstroke input).  Compared to baselines, MagicQuill achieved improved edge alignment and color fidelity with a lower LPIPS score of 0.0667 and a higher PSNR of 27.282 on a constructed test dataset.  The paper does not report standard deviations for these or other metrics, making statistical significance unclear. It is unclear how ground truth images were obtained for this evaluation.  AI practitioners can leverage this architecture to develop more user-friendly and precise image editing tools, integrating MLLMs to understand user intent from freehand input and enhance generative control in diffusion-based editing.  However, the paper does not adequately discuss the generalizability of the Draw&Guess dataset and the robustness of the trained MLLM across diverse user sketch styles and potential ambiguities.  |
| LLaMA-Mesh: Unifying 3D Mesh Generation with Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09595) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.09595))| Jun Zhu, Hang Su, Yikai Wang, Jonathan Lorraine, Zhengyi Wang | LLaMA-Mesh enables large language models (LLMs) to generate 3D meshes directly from text prompts.  The research aimed to unify 3D mesh generation and text generation within a single LLM framework.  The key methodology involved representing 3D mesh vertex coordinates and face definitions as plain text within the OBJ file format, enabling direct integration with the LLM without vocabulary expansion.  LLaMA-Mesh achieved mesh generation quality comparable to specialized models while retaining language capabilities, scoring 61.74 on MMLU (5-shot) compared to the baseline LLaMA3.1 (8B) score of 66.07. This allows AI practitioners to leverage the text-based knowledge embedded in LLMs for 3D content creation, opening up new possibilities for language-driven 3D modeling.  |
| Cut Your Losses in Large-Vocabulary Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09009) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.09009))| Philipp Krähenbühl, Vladlen Koltun, Alexander Hertzberg, Brody Huval, erikwijmans | Cut Cross-Entropy (CCE) reduces memory footprint of cross-entropy loss in large language models.  The authors aimed to address the disproportionately large memory consumption of cross-entropy loss computation in large language models, especially those with extensive vocabularies. CCE computes cross-entropy without materializing the full logit matrix, instead calculating logits on-the-fly and leveraging sparsity in the softmax gradient. Using CCE with the Gemma 2 (2B) model, memory for loss computation decreased from 24GB to 1MB, and overall classifier head memory from 28GB to 1GB. This allows practitioners training LLMs to significantly increase batch size during training or train larger models on existing hardware due to reduced memory requirements.  |
| ClinicalBench: Can LLMs Beat Traditional ML Models in Clinical Prediction? (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06469) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.06469))| Zhongwei Wan, Che Liu, Shan Chen, Jian Yu, canyuchen | ClinicalBench benchmarks LLMs and traditional ML models on clinical prediction tasks.  The research investigates whether LLMs can outperform traditional ML models in clinical prediction. The benchmark uses two clinical databases (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and evaluates performance on three common clinical prediction tasks (length-of-stay, mortality, and readmission) with various LLMs (general-purpose and medical) and traditional ML models, using prompting and fine-tuning strategies. Across all tasks and datasets, traditional ML models generally outperformed LLMs, with XGBoost achieving a Macro F1-score of 67.94% on length-of-stay prediction in MIMIC-III, substantially higher than LLMs.  AI practitioners should exercise caution when applying LLMs to clinical prediction tasks, as they currently do not demonstrate superiority over established ML methods, despite strong performance on medical question answering benchmarks.  |
| Hermes: A Large Language Model Framework on the Journey to Autonomous Networks (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06490) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.06490))| Merouane Debbah, Antonio De Domenico, Ali Maatouk, Fadhel Ayed, nicopi | Hermes is a chain-of-agent LLM framework for modeling and automating cellular network operations using "blueprints" for constructing Network Digital Twins (NDTs).  The research investigates whether LLMs can effectively model network behavior and advance network autonomy.  The key methodology involves a three-phase process where a "Designer" LLM agent creates a blueprint for a NDT, a "Coder" agent translates it into Python code, and a feedback loop refines the blueprint based on numerical evaluation. When using GPT-40 as the LLM, Hermes achieved a success rate of 82.5% in modeling power control and energy saving tasks, compared to 25% for chain-of-thought and 55% for Hermes-coder (without the Designer). The success rate varies based on the complexity of the modeling task and with the specific LLMs being employed and increases substantially with the inclusion of domain specific models in the model repository. This indicates that integrating structured blueprints with domain expertise enhances LLM reliability in network modeling tasks and paves the way for more robust autonomous network operations using LLMs.  |
| Sharingan: Extract User Action Sequence from Desktop Recordings (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08768) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.08768))| Kehong Yuan, Jue Zhang, Xiaoting Qin, Yi Ren, Yanting Chen | Sharingan introduces two VLM-based methods to extract user action sequences from desktop recordings: Direct Frame-Based (DF) and Differential Frame-Based (DiffF).  The research aims to determine the efficacy of VLMs in extracting user actions from desktop video recordings.  Both methods use VLMs (GPT and Gemini series) to process video frames, with DiffF incorporating explicit frame difference detection.  On the ACTONE dataset, the DF approach with GPT-40 achieved 70-80% accuracy in identifying operation types, with extracted sequences being replayable via RPA.  This work enables AI practitioners to explore desktop video as a data source for RPA, automated tutorial generation, and user behavior analysis.  |

| Large Language Models Can Self-Improve in Long-context Reasoning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08147) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.08147))| Mo Yu, Lemao Liu, Zesen Cheng, Cheng Yang, Siheng99 | SEALONG, a novel self-improvement method for LLMs, enhances long-context reasoning.  The research investigates LLMs' capacity for self-improvement in reasoning over extended text.  The methodology involves sampling multiple output reasoning trajectories, scoring them using Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR), and fine-tuning via supervised learning or preference optimization.  Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct improved by 4.2 points using SEALONG, outperforming prior methods relying on expert-generated data. This self-improvement technique allows LLMs to enhance their long-context reasoning abilities without external annotations, offering a scalable path towards more advanced reasoning capabilities for AI practitioners.  |
| EgoVid-5M: A Large-Scale Video-Action Dataset for Egocentric Video Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08380) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.08380))| Guosheng Zhao, Jiayu Wang, Feng Liu, Kang Zhao, Xiaofeng Wang | EgoVid-5M is a 5-million-clip dataset designed for training egocentric video generation models.  The research aimed to create a high-quality dataset to address the challenges of generating egocentric videos due to dynamic viewpoints, action diversity, and scene complexity.  The researchers annotated EgoVid-5M with fine-grained kinematic control data using Visual Inertial Odometry and high-level textual descriptions via a multimodal large language model, and then implemented a data cleaning pipeline addressing text-video and frame-frame consistency, motion smoothness, and video clarity. Training a DynamiCrafter model on EgoVid-1M-3 (a subset of EgoVid-5M) resulted in an improved CD-FVD score compared to models trained on alternative cleaning strategies. AI practitioners can now leverage EgoVid-5M and its associated metadata to train and evaluate egocentric video generation models, potentially advancing applications in virtual/augmented reality and gaming.  |
| Direct Preference Optimization Using Sparse Feature-Level Constraints (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07618) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.07618))| Hanqi Yan, Minjun Zhu, Hongbo Zhang, Chak Tou Leong, Qingyu Yin | FPO (Feature-level constrained Preference Optimization) improves large language model (LLM) alignment by using sparse feature-level constraints.  The research aimed to develop a more efficient and controllable method for aligning LLMs to human preferences than existing methods like RLHF and DPO.  FPO leverages pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduces feature-level constraints within a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) framework, minimizing mean squared error (MSE) between sparse activations. On the AlpacaEval-2 benchmark, FPO achieved a win rate improvement of up to 5.08% compared to baseline methods.  This provides AI practitioners with a more efficient and stable method for aligning LLMs, potentially reducing computational costs and improving generation quality.  |
| CamemBERT 2.0: A Smarter French Language Model Aged to Perfection (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08868) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.08868))| Benoît Sagot, Éric de la Clergerie, Rian Touchent, Francis Kulumba, Wissam Antoun | This paper introduces CamemBERT 2.0, two updated French language models: CamemBERTav2 (DeBERTaV3 architecture, Replaced Token Detection objective) and CamemBERTv2 (RoBERTa architecture, Masked Language Modeling objective).  The objective is to address temporal concept drift and improve performance on various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.  Both models were trained on a larger, more recent 275B token dataset with an updated tokenizer designed to better capture French linguistic nuances. CamemBERTav2 achieved an F1 score of 93.4% on named entity recognition (NER) using the FTB dataset, significantly outperforming the original CamemBERT (89.97%). AI practitioners can leverage these updated, open-source models for improved performance in various French NLP applications, including specialized domains like biomedicine, highlighting the importance of continuous model updates and data freshness in mitigating concept drift.  |
| Can sparse autoencoders be used to decompose and interpret steering vectors? (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08790) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.08790))| Adam Mahdi, Yushi Yang, Harry Mayne | This paper investigates why directly applying sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to steering vectors yields misleading decompositions. The research aims to understand why SAEs provide inaccurate interpretations of steering vectors, which are used to control the behavior of large language models.  The methodology involves decomposing steering vectors for "corrigibility" in a language model using SAEs and comparing them to decompositions of zero vectors and model activations. The primary results show that the L2-norm of the corrigibility steering vector is substantially smaller than that of typical model activations, and that 51.2% of relevant features show stronger activations on negative example prompts.  This implies that SAE interpretations of steering vectors are often dominated by the encoder bias and fail to capture meaningful negative projections in feature directions, hindering their direct use for interpreting how these vectors influence language model behavior.  |

The research questions which models are the most effective response generators for instruction tuning and how to determine effective response generators without instruction tuning.  The authors fine-tuned five base LLMs on instruction datasets generated by 20 different response generators and evaluated them on AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks.  Gemma-2-9b-it and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct emerged as the two best response generators, outperforming larger models and even GPT-4 in some cases (e.g., average performance of 13.92% and 16.15% on Llama-3.1-Minitron-4B, respectively, compared to 5.72% for GPT-4). The proposed Compatibility-Adjusted Reward (CAR) metric, accounting for both response quality and compatibility with the base model, outperformed baseline metrics in predicting response generator effectiveness. AI practitioners should prioritize response generators with high compatibility with the base LLM, as measured by CAR, rather than solely relying on benchmark performance, to maximize the effectiveness of instruction tuning.  |

| Watermark Anything with Localized Messages (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07231) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.07231))| Matthijs Douze, Teddy Furon, Alain Durmus, Pierre Fernandez, Tom Sander | The Watermark Anything Model (WAM) performs localized image watermarking, enabling segmentation of watermarked areas and extraction of multiple messages.  The research aimed to develop a watermarking method robust to image manipulations like splicing and inpainting, even with small watermarked areas.  A two-stage training process was employed: initial training for robustness at low resolution followed by fine-tuning for imperceptibility and multiple watermark handling using a JND map.  WAM achieved over 85% mIoU for detection of watermarked areas when hiding five 32-bit messages in 10% areas of an image, even after horizontal flips and contrast adjustments.  AI practitioners can utilize WAM for robust localization of watermarked areas and extraction of distinct messages from within a single image, enabling novel applications like verification of content origin and detection of AI-generated objects within images.  |
| Counterfactual Generation from Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07180) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.07180))| Ryan Cotterell, Anej Svete, vesteinn, Shauli | This paper introduces a framework for generating true counterfactual strings from language models.  The research aimed to understand and mitigate the unintended side effects of common language model intervention techniques. The key methodology involved formulating language models as Generalized Structural-equation Models (GSEMs) using the Gumbel-max trick, enabling counterfactual reasoning.  Results showed that even "minimal" interventions like MEMIT and linear steering induce significant semantic shifts in generated text, with instruction tuning interventions showing the most unintended side-effects (sharing only 24% of tokens with original strings on average).  This implies that AI practitioners should carefully evaluate the potential for unintended consequences, even with seemingly targeted interventions, and consider the proposed GSEM framework for analyzing and mitigating these effects.  |
| Game-theoretic LLM: Agent Workflow for Negotiation Games (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05990) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.05990))| Julie Chen, Alfonso Amayuelas, Lingyao Li, Ollie Liu, Wenyue Hua | This paper investigates the rationality of Large Language Models (LLMs) in strategic decision-making within game-theoretic scenarios.  The research objective is to evaluate LLM rationality in both complete and incomplete information games and explore methods to enhance it.  The authors design and implement game-theory-inspired workflows, including dominant strategy search and backward induction, to guide LLM reasoning.  In "Deal or No Deal",  Claude-3.5 Sonnet with workflow achieved a 95.45% agreement rate.  A key implication for AI practitioners is that incorporating structured, game-theoretic workflows into LLM agents can significantly improve their negotiation performance and strategic decision-making in complex, multi-agent environments, but the choice of *whether* to use a workflow is itself a strategic decision.  |
| Golden Touchstone: A Comprehensive Bilingual Benchmark for Evaluating Financial Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06272) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.06272))| Yiyan Qi, Zhouchi Lin, Huanyi Su, Junxi Liu, Xiaojun Wu | Golden Touchstone is a bilingual benchmark for evaluating financial large language models (LLMs).  The research aimed to create a comprehensive, bilingual benchmark to evaluate FinLLMs on a wider range of tasks and in both English and Chinese. The benchmark includes 22 datasets across eight core financial NLP tasks,  and performance was assessed for several LLMs including GPT-40, Llama-3, and a newly developed model, Touchstone-GPT, trained using continuous pre-training and financial instruction tuning.  Llama-3 achieved the highest Weighted-F1 score (0.5116) on the English stock movement prediction task, though all models underperformed on this challenging task.  This suggests that current LLMs struggle with complex financial prediction tasks and that benchmarks like Golden Touchstone are crucial for directing further research and model development in financial AI.  |
| Ablation is Not Enough to Emulate DPO: How Neuron Dynamics Drive Toxicity Reduction (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06424) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.06424))| Adam Mahdi, Harry Mayne, Filip Sondej, Yushi Yang | This paper investigates the mechanisms by which Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) reduces toxicity in language models. The research aims to determine how DPO’s internal mechanisms lead to toxicity reduction in language models, challenging the existing explanation that it primarily dampens the most toxic MLP neurons.  The study uses ablation of toxic neurons, activation patching, and projection of neuron activation changes onto a toxicity probe in GPT-2 medium.  Results show that dampening toxic neurons accounts for only 31.8% of the total toxicity reduction, with a significant portion coming from promoting anti-toxicity via other neuron groups and noisy adjustments across many neurons. This suggests for AI practitioners that mitigating toxicity in LLMs requires a more nuanced approach than simply targeting the most toxic neurons, and that a more holistic understanding of neuron dynamics is essential for effective toxicity reduction.  |
| KMM: Key Frame Mask Mamba for Extended Motion Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06481) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.06481))| Feng Chen, Qi Chen, Akide Liu, Zeyu Zhang, Ha0Tang | This paper introduces Key Frame Mask Mamba (KMM) for generating extended human motion sequences from text.  The research aims to address limitations of existing methods, specifically memory decay and weak text-motion alignment, in generating long and complex motions from text prompts. The core methodology involves a novel key frame masking strategy based on local density and a contrastive learning approach for text-motion alignment within the Mamba architecture.  On the BABEL dataset, KMM achieved a 57% improvement in Frechet Inception Distance (FID) compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. This implies that AI practitioners can leverage KMM to generate higher-quality, more text-aligned extended motion sequences, potentially benefiting applications in animation, gaming, and virtual reality.  |

The research aims to mitigate pipeline bubbles and memory bottlenecks arising from uneven workload distribution across pipeline stages due to vocabulary layers. The core methodology involves partitioning vocabulary layers across all pipeline devices, grouping computations into pipeline passes, and minimizing communication barriers within these layers.  Results show up to a 51% improvement in throughput compared to naive approaches, and near-perfect memory balance when combined with the V-Half scheduling strategy. This allows AI practitioners training large language models with pipeline parallelism to achieve significantly improved throughput and reduced memory consumption, particularly in large vocabulary scenarios, enabling training of larger models or using larger batch sizes.  |
| StdGEN: Semantic-Decomposed 3D Character Generation from Single Images (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05738) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.05738))| Kaiwen Xiao, Zhongkai Wu, Wang Zhao, Yanning Zhou, Yuze He | StdGEN is a novel pipeline for generating semantically decomposed 3D characters from single images.  The research aimed to create a method for generating high-quality, decomposable 3D characters from single images, addressing limitations of existing methods in decomposability, quality, and optimization time.

The primary research question is how well PEFT methods perform on unit test generation compared to full fine-tuning and in relation to resource utilization. The study evaluates LoRA, (IA)³, and prompt tuning against full fine-tuning across ten LLMs of varying sizes using the METHODS2TEST and HumanEval-X datasets, measuring syntactic correctness, CodeBLEU similarity, and code coverage. LoRA achieved the highest CodeBLEU scores in five out of ten models and was the only method to improve CodeBLEU for CodeLlama-7B.  AI practitioners can leverage PEFT, especially LoRA, to efficiently fine-tune LLMs for unit test generation, potentially matching or exceeding the performance of full fine-tuning while significantly reducing computational costs.  |
| LLM2CLIP: Powerful Language Model Unlock Richer Visual Representation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04997) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.04997))| Yuqing Yang, Xufang Luo, Aoqi Wu, Weiquan Huang, Yif29 | LLM2CLIP enhances visual representations by integrating large language models (LLMs) into CLIP training.  The research aimed to determine if LLMs could improve multimodal representation learning, addressing CLIP's limitations with complex and long text.  The key methodology involved caption contrastive fine-tuning of the LLM and a novel training process where the fine-tuned LLM guides CLIP's visual encoder.  LLM2CLIP boosted the performance of the SOTA EVA02 model by 16.5% on long and short-text retrieval tasks.  This implies that AI practitioners can leverage LLM2CLIP to significantly improve the performance of existing and future multimodal models relying on CLIP, especially in tasks involving complex or long textual descriptions.  |

Nguyen, Anh M. T. Bui, Nam Le Hai | This paper presents a novel dataset and methods for improving the detection of technical debt (TD) in Java source code.  The research aimed to determine if manually classified comments and source code context enhance the detection of self-admitted technical debt (SATD). The authors curated a dataset, TESORO, by extracting SATD comments and corresponding source code from Java projects, then manually classifying TD types.  Experiments using pre-trained language models (PLMs) like CodeBERT and RoBERTa showed that adding TESORO to training data improved SATD detection F1-scores by up to 14.59%.  This suggests AI practitioners can significantly improve the performance of their TD detection models by incorporating source code context and leveraging datasets like TESORO for training.  |

| ReCapture: Generative Video Camera Controls for User-Provided Videos using Masked Video Fine-Tuning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05003) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.05003))| David E. Jacobs, Nikhil Karnad, Shiran Zada, Roni Paiss, David Junhao Zhang | ReCapture enables generating novel camera trajectories for existing user-provided videos while preserving scene content and dynamics.  The research aims to develop a method for generating videos with new camera trajectories from single user-provided videos without needing paired training data.  The method uses masked video fine-tuning with spatial and temporal Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRAs) applied to a pre-trained video diffusion model, conditioned on an intermediate "anchor video" generated via either point cloud rendering or multi-view diffusion. On the Kubric-4D dataset, ReCapture achieves a PSNR of 20.92, outperforming existing 4D reconstruction and generative methods.

| BitNet a4.8: 4-bit Activations for 1-bit LLMs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04965) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.04965))| Furu Wei, Shuming Ma, Hongyu Wang | BitNet a4.8 introduces a hybrid quantization and sparsification strategy enabling 4-bit activations for 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs).  The research aimed to reduce the inference cost of 1-bit LLMs while maintaining performance comparable to higher-precision models like BitNet b1.58.  The method involves using 4-bit activations for inputs to attention and feed-forward network layers, sparsifying intermediate states with 8-bit quantization, and a two-stage training recipe from 8-bit to 4-bit activations.  For a 7B parameter model, BitNet a4.8 achieved similar performance to BitNet b1.58 on downstream tasks, while having only 55% activated parameters (3.4B).  This allows AI practitioners to deploy and infer large language models more efficiently with reduced computational and memory requirements by leveraging 4-bit activations and sparsity.  |
| DimensionX: Create Any 3D and 4D Scenes from a Single Image with Controllable Video Diffusion (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04928) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.04928))| Zilong Chen, Fangfu Liu, Shuo Chen, Wenqiang Sun, yikaiw | DimensionX generates 3D and 4D scenes from a single image using controllable video diffusion.  The research aims to create photorealistic 3D and 4D scenes from single images using controllable video diffusion, addressing the limited spatial and temporal control in existing video diffusion models. The key methodology is ST-Director, which decouples spatial and temporal factors in video diffusion by learning dimension-aware LoRAs from specifically curated datasets, enabling control over individual dimensions and their combination.  On the Tank and Temples dataset for sparse-view 3D generation, DimensionX achieves 20.42 PSNR, 0.668 SSIM, and 0.185 LPIPS, outperforming baseline methods. This provides AI practitioners with a more controllable and effective approach for generating 3D and 4D content from limited input data, enabling applications in various fields like virtual reality and content creation.  |
| Mixture-of-Transformers: A Sparse and Scalable Architecture for Multi-Modal Foundation Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04996) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.04996))| Ning Dong, Srinivasan Iyer, Liang Luo, Lili Yu, WxWx | Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) accelerates multi-modal foundation model pretraining by decoupling non-embedding parameters by modality.  The paper investigates whether modality-specific parameterization in transformers can improve multi-modal pretraining efficiency without compromising performance.  MoT isolates parameters like feed-forward networks, attention matrices, and layer normalization by modality while maintaining global self-attention across all input tokens.  This creates separate transformer towers for each modality.  In the Chameleon 7B text and image generation setting, MoT matched dense model performance using only 55.8% of the FLOPs. Across various multi-modal datasets and training setups (Chameleon, Chameleon+Speech, Transfusion), MoT consistently reduced training FLOPs and wall-clock time, particularly for image generation. Further analysis comparing MoT against Mixture-of-Experts and analyzing modality separation effects via Leave-One-Out analysis is provided, but the methodology used in these analyses is not fully clear.  AI practitioners can use MoT to significantly reduce computational costs and training time for large multi-modal foundation models without significant performance degradation, especially in image-related tasks.  |

The research aims to improve the quality and social appropriateness of LLM responses in interactive dialogue settings by incorporating conversational skills.  A new skill-of-mind-annotated dataset, MULTIFACETED SKILL-OF-MIND, containing roughly 100K conversations, was created and used to fine-tune LLaMA models of varying sizes (1B, 3B, and 8B parameters).  THANOS 8B achieved an average of 29.7% accuracy on skill classification across multiple datasets, a substantial improvement over baseline LLM-based agents. AI practitioners can use THANOS and the MULTIFACETED SKILL-OF-MIND dataset to develop more socially adept and engaging conversational agents by grounding response generation in relevant conversational skills.  |
| TIP-I2V: A Million-Scale Real Text and Image Prompt Dataset for Image-to-Video Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04709) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.04709))| Yi Yang, Wenhao Wang | TIP-I2V is a novel million-scale dataset of user-provided text and image prompts for image-to-video generation.  The research aimed to create a dedicated dataset for studying user prompts in image-to-video generation, which was lacking previously. The dataset was curated by collecting text and image prompts from Pika Discord channels, along with generated videos from five state-of-the-art image-to-video models. The authors found significant semantic differences between TIP-I2V prompts and those in existing text-to-video (VidProM) and text-to-image (DiffusionDB) datasets, with TIP-I2V focusing on animating existing image content.  In benchmark evaluations using TIP-I2V, the early commercial model Pika outperformed the latest open-source model, CogVideoX-5B, in 8 out of 10 evaluation dimensions. This finding indicates that AI practitioners should consider real-world user prompt data when developing and evaluating image-to-video models.  |

| Needle Threading: Can LLMs Follow Threads through Near-Million-Scale Haystacks? (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05000) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.05000))| Samuel Albanie, Kai Han, Jonathan Roberts | This paper evaluates the long-context retrieval capabilities of 17 Large Language Models (LLMs).  The research investigates how effectively LLMs utilize their context windows, particularly in following "threads" of linked information.  The study uses synthetically generated datasets of key-value pairs (UUIDs) with varying context lengths up to 900k tokens and tests performance on single/multiple needle retrieval, conditional retrieval, and threading/multi-threading tasks.  Results show performance degradation with increasing context lengths and thread lengths in most models; for example, Gemini 1.5 Flash achieves 24% accuracy on multiple needle retrieval with 10 needles at a context length of 128k characters, but only 10% accuracy at 630k characters. This suggests the existence of a task-specific effective context limit shorter than the advertised model limit, which has implications for practical deployment scenarios.  |

A Systematic Analysis of Multimodal LLM Data Contamination (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03823) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.03823))| Benyou Wang, Lichao Sun, Shunian Chen, Sicheng Lai, Dingjie Song | MM-Detect, a framework for detecting multimodal data contamination in Large Language Models (LLMs), is introduced.  The research aims to analyze and detect data contamination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).  The framework employs two methods: Option Order Sensitivity Test for multiple-choice VQA and Slot Guessing for Perturbation Captions for caption-based VQA, alongside metrics evaluating performance changes after applying these perturbations.  Experiments on eleven MLLMs across five VQA datasets revealed that incorporating contaminated ScienceQA training data during LLaVA-1.5-7B training increased average CR by 8.2% and PCR by 3.7%.  This indicates that data contamination is prevalent in both open-source and proprietary MLLMs, impacting performance evaluation and potentially creating unfair comparisons, and thus should be considered by practitioners when developing and benchmarking MLLMs.  |

| Correlation of Object Detection Performance with Visual Saliency and Depth Estimation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02844) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.02844))| Dylan Seychell, mbar0075 | This paper investigates the correlation of object detection accuracy with visual saliency and depth prediction.  The research aimed to determine whether visual saliency or depth prediction correlates more strongly with object detection accuracy.  The study used four pre-trained models (DeepGaze IIE, Depth Anything, DPT-Large, and Itti's model) to generate predictions on the COCO and Pascal VOC datasets, comparing them to ground truth annotations using mean Average Pearson Correlation (mAp).  Visual saliency exhibited a stronger correlation (mAp up to 0.459 on Pascal VOC) with object detection accuracy than depth prediction (mAp up to 0.283 on Pascal VOC). This suggests that incorporating visual saliency features into object detection models may improve performance, particularly in complex scenes.  |

| DynaMath: A Dynamic Visual Benchmark for Evaluating Mathematical Reasoning Robustness of Vision Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00836) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.00836))| Bin Hu, Junyu Zhang, Xingang Guo, Chengke Zou, Ray2333 | DYNAMATH, a dynamic visual benchmark, evaluates the robustness of Vision Language Models (VLMs) in mathematical reasoning.  The research investigated whether VLMs' reasoning procedures are robust to problem variations that pose no challenge to humans.  The key methodology involved creating 501 seed questions as Python programs, enabling generation of 5,010 concrete questions with variations in visual and textual content.  Evaluation showed the worst-case accuracy (percentage of correctly answered seed questions across all variants) of the best performing VLM, Claude-3.5, was 35.3%, significantly lower than its average-case accuracy.  This substantial difference between average-case and worst-case accuracy highlights the unreliability of current VLMs when handling variations in mathematical reasoning tasks, signaling a critical area for improvement in model robustness.  |
| Hunyuan-Large: An Open-Source MoE Model with 52 Billion Activated Parameters by Tencent (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02265) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.02265))| Jiaqi Zhu, Xingwu Sun, Ruobing-Xie, Mimosa77, YanfengChen | Tencent introduces Hunyuan-Large, a 389 billion parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 52 billion activated parameters.

The release of Hunyuan-Large offers AI practitioners a powerful, open-source MoE model for a wide range of applications, as well as insights into effective MoE model training for future development.  |
| How Far is Video Generation from World Model: A Physical Law Perspective (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02385) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.02385))| Yang Zhao, Zhijie Lin, Rui Lu, Bingyi Kang, Yang130 | Here's a summary of the AI research paper following the specified guidelines:  i) **1-line summary:**  A study evaluates the ability of scaled video generation models to learn and generalize fundamental physical laws from visual data alone.  ii) **Main research question/objective:** Can video generation models, scaled in data and parameters, discover and generalize fundamental physical laws solely from visual observations without human priors?  iii) **Key methodology:** A 2D physics simulation testbed generated videos of objects governed by deterministic physical laws (uniform linear motion, elastic collisions, parabolic motion).  Diffusion-based video generation models were trained and evaluated on in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and combinatorial generalization tasks.  Quantitative metrics assessed adherence to physical laws.  iv) **Primary results:**  While scaling improved in-distribution generalization, out-of-distribution generalization remained poor, with velocity errors an order of magnitude higher than in-distribution errors even with maximum model size and data.  Combinatorial generalization showed improvement with scaling but was still imperfect (67% to 10% reduction in “abnormal” cases). Analysis revealed a “case-based” generalization mechanism, prioritizing color over shape, size, and velocity.  v) **Principal implication for AI practitioners:** Scaling alone is insufficient for video generation models to uncover fundamental physical laws; models prioritize superficial visual features over underlying physical principles, necessitating further research on generalization mechanisms beyond simple scaling.  The significant gap between in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization suggests that current approaches have significant limitations in truly understanding and modeling the physical world.  |
| Survey of Cultural Awareness in Language Models: Text and Beyond (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00860) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.00860))| Junho Myung, Arnav Arora, Junyeong Park, jinjh0123, sidicity | This paper surveys research on incorporating cultural awareness into text-based and multimodal language models (LLMs).  The survey aims to consolidate research on making LLMs culturally inclusive, encompassing benchmarks, training data creation, and alignment methodologies. The authors review over 300 papers, categorizing cultural awareness efforts across various modalities, including image, video, and audio, in addition to text.  Multilingual descriptions in image captioning benchmarks yield 29.9% more objects, 24.5% more relations, and 46.0% more attributes compared to monolingual captions. AI practitioners should consider incorporating culture-specific data and benchmarks in the development and evaluation of LLMs to mitigate biases and improve cross-cultural understanding, but should carefully evaluate sources for bias, inconsistencies in culture definitions, and the ethical implications of cultural alignment.  |
| LIBMoE: A Library for comprehensive benchmarking Mixture of Experts in Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00918) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.00918))| Quang Pham, Van Nguyen, Luong Tran, doantienthongbku, DavidNguyen | LibMoE is a modular toolkit for streamlining the research, training, and evaluation of Mixture of Experts (MoE) algorithms in Large Language Models (LLMs).  The research aimed to develop a comprehensive framework making MoE algorithm research more accessible and standardized.  The key methodology involved implementing various state-of-the-art MoE algorithms within a modular framework incorporating distributed training and zero-shot evaluation across 11 benchmarks, utilizing sparse upcycling from pre-trained LLM checkpoints. Results showed no single MoE algorithm consistently outperformed others across all benchmarks, with performance averaging 55-56% accuracy across the tasks.

| Sparsing Law: Towards Large Language Models with Greater Activation Sparsity (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02335) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.02335))| Chaojun Xiao, Yingfa Chen, Chenyang Song, Yuqi Luo, SillyXu | This paper investigates scaling properties and influential factors of intrinsic activation sparsity in decoder-only Transformer LLMs.  The research aims to understand how to achieve greater activation sparsity in LLMs without compromising performance. Researchers used a proposed metric, PPL-p% sparsity, to measure activation sparsity while controlling for performance degradation (perplexity).  They found ReLU-activated LLMs achieve greater sparsity than SiLU-activated LLMs at the same parameter scale, while maintaining comparable performance. Specifically, ReLU activation ratio on a 0.1B parameter model converges to approximately 6.14%  with sufficient training data, whereas SiLU converges to approximately 40.9%. These findings suggest AI practitioners should consider ReLU as the activation function when aiming to maximize activation sparsity for efficiency and interpretability gains in LLMs.  |

| Randomized Autoregressive Visual Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00776) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.00776))| Liang-Chieh Chen, Xiaohui Shen, Xueqing Deng, turkeyju, yucornetto | This paper introduces Randomized AutoRegressive modeling (RAR) for enhanced visual generation using autoregressive transformers.  The objective is to improve autoregressive image generation quality while maintaining compatibility with language modeling frameworks.  RAR uses a randomness annealing training strategy where input image tokens are randomly permuted during training with a probability that linearly decays from 1 to 0, encouraging bidirectional context learning. On ImageNet-256, RAR achieves a FID score of 1.48, surpassing previous autoregressive and even some leading diffusion and masked transformer models.  This implies that AI practitioners can leverage RAR to develop higher-quality autoregressive image generation models that are also compatible with existing language modeling architectures and optimization techniques.  |
| Adapting While Learning: Grounding LLMs for Scientific Problems with Intelligent Tool Usage Adaptation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00412) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.00412))| Leon Bergen, Duncan Watson-Parris, Yadi Cao, yuqirose, Bohan22 | The paper introduces a two-stage training method to improve LLM performance on scientific problems, balancing inherent reasoning and external tool use.  The research aims to address the issue of LLMs over-relying on tools or hallucinating answers for complex scientific problems.  The methodology involves World Knowledge Distillation (WKD) to internalize domain knowledge and Tool Usage Adaptation (TUA) to train adaptive tool usage based on problem complexity. Results show an average 28.18% improvement in answer accuracy and a 13.89% improvement in tool usage precision across six scientific datasets. This implies that AI practitioners can enhance LLM accuracy and efficiency on scientific tasks by training models to adaptively leverage external tools based on problem difficulty.  |
| Personalization of Large Language Models: A Survey (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00027) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.00027))| Yijia Shao, Branislav Kveton, Ryan A. Rossi, Zhehao Zhang, Franck-Dernoncourt | This paper surveys techniques for personalizing Large Language Models (LLMs).  The authors aim to unify the disparate research on personalized text generation and downstream task personalization using LLMs.  They propose taxonomies for personalization granularity (user-level, persona-level, global preference), techniques (RAG, prompting, representation learning, RLHF), evaluation metrics (intrinsic, extrinsic), and datasets.  One study found that larger LLMs (100B+ parameters) performed comparably or better than traditional recommender systems in user rating prediction after fine-tuning with minimal user interaction data.  AI practitioners can leverage these taxonomies and techniques, along with insights into evaluation and datasets, to build more user-centric and effective personalized LLM applications.  |
| SambaMixer: State of Health Prediction of Li-ion Batteries using Mamba State Space Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00233) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.00233))| Sergio Martin, Clara Pérez-Molina, sascha-kirch, jolalde5 | SambaMixer is a novel structured state space model (SSM) for predicting the state of health (SOH) of Li-ion batteries.  The objective is to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately predicting Li-ion battery SOH using multivariate time series data from discharge cycles. The proposed SambaMixer model uses a MambaMixer architecture incorporating anchor-based resampling of time series data, positional encodings based on sample time and time between discharge cycles, and a regression head.  On the NASA battery dataset, SambaMixer achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.072% for SOH prediction.  This result suggests that SambaMixer, using Mamba SSMs, offers a performant and efficient alternative to transformer-based models for multivariate time series prediction tasks relevant to battery health management.  |
| In-Context LoRA for Diffusion Transformers (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23775) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.23775))| Huanzhang Dou, Yupeng Shi, Zhi-Fan Wu, Wei Wang, lhhuang | This paper introduces In-Context LoRA (IC-LORA), a method for adapting text-to-image diffusion transformers to diverse generative tasks.  The research investigates whether existing text-to-image DiTs possess inherent in-context generation capabilities and, if so, how to effectively leverage them.  The key methodology involves concatenating images and their corresponding captions, then fine-tuning a LoRA with small task-specific datasets (20-100 samples).  Qualitative results demonstrate high-fidelity image set generation across various tasks, including portrait photography, font design, and home decoration. The paper does not present quantitative benchmarks, so specific performance metrics like FID or CLIP scores are unavailable.  This pipeline offers AI practitioners a simplified and computationally efficient approach to adapt pre-trained text-to-image models for various downstream tasks without extensive training or architectural modifications, emphasizing the potential of inherent in-context learning capabilities within these models.  |
| M2rc-Eval: Massively Multilingual Repository-level Code Completion Evaluation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21157) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.21157))| Shukai Liu, Jian Yang, Congnan Liu, Ken Deng, Jiaheng Liu | This paper introduces M²RC-EVAL, a benchmark for evaluating repository-level code completion in multiple programming languages.  The objective is to address the limitations of existing benchmarks that focus on few languages and lack fine-grained analysis, hindering comprehensive evaluation of multilingual code LLMs.  The researchers created M²RC-EVAL by collecting data from The Stack v2, selecting completion positions based on abstract syntax tree (AST) nodes, and adding bucket-level and semantic-level annotations.  After fine-tuning StarCoder-7B on the accompanying M²RC-INSTRUCT dataset, the model achieved 44.4% exact match and 71.4% edit similarity on M²RC-EVAL, significantly outperforming the non-finetuned model. The demonstrated effectiveness of cross-file context and fine-tuning on M²RC-INSTRUCT  indicates that AI practitioners should incorporate these elements when developing or improving code LLMs for real-world repository-level completion tasks, particularly in multilingual settings.  |
| HelloMeme: Integrating Spatial Knitting Attentions to Embed High-Level and Fidelity-Rich Conditions in Diffusion Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22901) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.22901))| Chenhui Xue, Chaojie Yang, Tian Li, Nianhong Jiao, Shengkai Zhang | HelloMeme introduces Spatial Knitting Attentions (SK Attentions) to enhance text-to-image diffusion models for complex downstream tasks like meme video generation.  The research aimed to develop a method for adapting pre-trained text-to-image models to specialized tasks without sacrificing generalization performance.  The core methodology involves integrating adapters employing SK Attentions into the diffusion model's UNet architecture, facilitating the fusion of high-level (head pose, facial expression) and fidelity-rich (reference image) features. In self-reenactment experiments, the method achieved an average PSNR of 31.08 dB, outperforming other open-source state-of-the-art methods. This method provides AI practitioners with a plugin-based approach for post-training text-to-image models, enabling adaptation to tasks requiring high fidelity and complex control while preserving the base model's capabilities.  |
| Zipfian Whitening (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00680) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.00680))| Hidetoshi Shimodaira, Hiroto Kurita, Han Bao, Sho Yokoi | This paper proposes Zipfian whitening, a post-processing method for word embeddings that incorporates word frequency.  The research investigates whether accounting for the non-uniform distribution of word frequencies (Zipf's law) when symmetrizing word embedding spaces improves downstream task performance.  The key methodology involves performing PCA whitening weighted by empirical word frequencies, emphasizing low-frequency words.  Zipfian whitening consistently outperformed standard centering/whitening and other baselines, achieving a 66.92% score on the STS-B benchmark using GloVe embeddings.  AI practitioners should consider using Zipfian whitening as a post-processing step for word embeddings, as it demonstrably improves performance on downstream tasks by better capturing the information content of rare words.  |
| WikiNER-fr-gold: A Gold-Standard NER Corpus (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00030) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.00030))| Pierre-François Marteau, Nicolas Béchet, Danrun Cao | This paper presents WikiNER-fr-gold, a manually corrected version of a subset of the French portion of the WikiNER corpus for Named Entity Recognition (NER).

The corrected sub-corpus, WikiNER-fr-gold, exhibits improved annotation consistency compared to the original WikiNER-fr. This provides AI practitioners with a higher-quality gold-standard French NER dataset for training and evaluating NER models, potentially improving their performance.  |
| Survey of User Interface Design and Interaction Techniques in Generative AI Applications (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22370) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.22370))| Reuben Luera, puneetm, zhangry868, subright, Franck-Dernoncourt | This paper surveys user interface (UI) design and interaction techniques in user-guided generative AI applications.  The objective is to create a design compendium of current UI/UX trends and techniques for generative AI, focusing on user-guided interactions. The methodology involved surveying over 100 research articles on generative AI, categorizing UI interaction techniques, layouts, and human-AI engagement levels. The survey identified common interaction patterns like prompting, selection, system manipulation, and object manipulation, as well as prevalent UI layouts like conversational and canvas-based interfaces. One key finding is that users utilizing hybrid interactions in DirectGPT completed tasks 50% faster compared to single-dimensional interactions like those in ChatGPT. This implies that AI practitioners should consider incorporating multimodal and hybrid interaction designs to optimize user workflow and efficiency in generative AI applications.  |
| GRS-QA -- Graph Reasoning-Structured Question Answering Dataset (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00369) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.00369))| Jincen Shuai, Devasha Trivedi, Anish Pahilajani, Franck-Dernoncourt, namyongp | GRS-QA, a new dataset, is introduced for evaluating multi-hop question answering models with explicit reasoning structures.  The research aimed to investigate the impact of reasoning structures on Large Language Model (LLM) performance in multi-hop question answering.  The authors constructed reasoning graphs from existing multi-hop QA datasets, categorizing them by structure and generating negative samples by perturbing graph structures.  When using retrieved evidence, GPT-3.5 achieved an F1 score of 0.70 on bridge_2_1 questions and 0.78 on comparison_2_1 questions.  AI practitioners should consider reasoning structures alongside semantic content when developing and evaluating multi-hop QA models, as model performance varies significantly with differing reasoning graph complexities.  |

| Unpacking SDXL Turbo: Interpreting Text-to-Image Models with Sparse Autoencoders (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22366) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.22366))| Robert West, Justin Deschenaux, Mikhail Terekhov, Chris Wendler, surokpro2 | This paper investigates the interpretability of SDXL Turbo, a few-step text-to-image diffusion model.  The research objective is to understand the computational roles of transformer blocks within SDXL Turbo's U-net during image generation. The methodology involves training sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on the updates performed by four key transformer blocks, followed by qualitative and quantitative analysis of the learned features.  The results reveal that different transformer blocks specialize in distinct aspects of image generation, such as composition (down.2.1), local details (up.0.0), and style/color (up.0.1), with average pairwise CLIP similarity between images activating the same feature being significantly higher than the random baseline.  This specialization suggests that AI practitioners can potentially manipulate specific image attributes by targeting interventions at corresponding transformer blocks within SDXL Turbo or similar architectures.  |
| What Happened in LLMs Layers when Trained for Fast vs. Slow Thinking: A Gradient Perspective (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23743) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.23743))| Tianyi Zhou, Yanhong Li, MingLiiii | This paper investigates the layer-wise gradient patterns in LLMs during instruction-tuning with varying reasoning paths and response types.  The research aims to understand how "fast" (without Chain-of-Thought) and "slow" (with detailed Chain-of-Thought) thinking affects the training dynamics of LLMs. The study analyzes gradient norms, particularly in projection layers (Query, Key, Value, Output), using Singular Value Decomposition and metrics like Mean Absolute Difference and Relative Difference, across different layers and models (pre-trained and instruction-finetuned).  Results on datasets like AQUA and ECQA show that slow thinking leads to more stable gradients across layers, with smaller Mean Absolute Differences compared to fast thinking (e.g., on AQUA, fast thinking had a MAD of 4.42, while slow thinking had a MAD of 0.28 for all projection layers).  This suggests slow thinking, via CoT, improves the stability of LLM training and potentially informs more efficient and stable instruction-tuning strategies for AI practitioners.  |
| A Pointer Network-based Approach for Joint Extraction and Detection of Multi-Label Multi-Class Intents (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22476) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.22476))| Pawan Goyal, Gajula Sai Chaitanya, Abhilash Nandy, Sombit Bose, Ankan Mullick | This paper introduces a novel approach for extracting multiple intent spans and detecting multiple intents within a sentence.  The research aimed to address the limitations of existing intent detection models, which primarily handle single-intent queries, by developing a model capable of extracting multiple intent spans and classifying coarse and fine-grained intent labels.  The researchers propose a pointer network-based architecture (MLMCID) using RoBERTa and XLM-R embeddings with a novel multi-label, multi-class intent dataset (MLMCID-dataset).  RoBERTa with Pointer Network in MLMCID achieved 92.3% accuracy and 88.3% Macro F1-score for primary intent detection with coarse labels on the CLINC dataset.  This research provides AI practitioners with a specialized architecture for building more robust and context-aware dialogue systems capable of handling complex, multi-intent user queries, even in few-shot settings.  |

The key methodology involved generating constraints from existing instruction-response pairs using Llama3-70B-Instruct and creating a dataset called CRAB. Post-training on CRAB improved performance across benchmarks, with Llama3CRAB+DPO achieving 49.7% average score on IFEval. This implies that AI practitioners can leverage constraint back-translation to improve the complex instruction-following capabilities of LLMs.  |
| Language Models can Self-Lengthen to Generate Long Texts (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23933) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.23933))| Dayiheng Liu, An Yang, Bowen Yu, Tianyi Tang, Shanghaoran Quan | Self-Lengthen, an iterative training framework, enhances LLMs' ability to generate long, aligned text.  The research aimed to address the limitation of current LLMs in generating lengthy, aligned outputs due to a training gap in pre-training and post-training data.  The methodology involves a Generator that produces initial responses and an Extender that lengthens them iteratively, with both models being retrained on the longer outputs.  Experiments showed Self-Lengthen increased output length from approximately 1,000 words to 8,000 words while preserving quality.  This provides AI practitioners a method to improve long text generation capabilities of LLMs without needing external long-form data or proprietary models.  |
| BenchX: A Unified Benchmark Framework for Medical Vision-Language Pretraining on Chest X-Rays (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21969) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.21969))| Xinxing Xu, Sicong Leng, Yanyu Xu, Tan Li Hui Faith, youngzhou12 | BenchX provides a standardized benchmark for evaluating Medical Vision-Language Pretraining (MedVLP) models on chest X-ray tasks.  The research aimed to create a unified framework for comparing and analyzing MedVLP methods, addressing inconsistencies in existing evaluation protocols.  The framework uses the MIMIC-CXR dataset for pretraining and nine public chest X-ray datasets across classification, segmentation, report generation, and retrieval tasks, with standardized preprocessing and finetuning protocols.  ConVIRT, an early MedVLP method, achieved 77.0% AUROC on NIH ChestX-ray dataset with 1% of training data when finetuned with layer normalization, truncated normal initialization, and discriminative learning rates.  This suggests that proper training configurations are crucial for evaluating MedVLP methods and that the efficacy of some older models may be underestimated due to variations in prior evaluation methodologies.  |
| BitStack: Fine-Grained Size Control for Compressed Large Language Models in Variable Memory Environments (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23918) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.23918))| Yunhua Zhou, Dong Zhang, Bo Wang, Pengyu Wang, Xinghao Wang | BitStack is a training-free weight compression method for LLMs that allows dynamic adjustment of model size based on available memory.  The research aimed to address the challenge of deploying compressed LLMs in environments with variable memory availability. The core methodology involves iterative absolute value decomposition of weight matrices and sorting of resulting residual blocks based on their impact on perplexity, allowing dynamic loading and unloading of these blocks. On the Llama 3.1 70B model, BitStack achieved 89% of the original FP16 model's zero-shot performance at a high compression ratio.  This allows AI practitioners to deploy LLMs on resource-constrained devices and dynamically adjust the model size based on real-time memory availability, improving usability and performance within memory constraints.   |
| Navigating the Unknown: A Chat-Based Collaborative Interface for Personalized Exploratory Tasks (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24032) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.24032))| Qingwei Lin, Jue Zhang, Zhiyang Zhang, Xiaoting Qin, Yingzhe Peng | CARE, a chat-based collaborative interface, enhances personalized exploratory tasks using a multi-agent LLM framework.  The research aimed to improve personalization and reduce cognitive load in LLM-based chatbots for exploratory tasks, particularly when users begin with vague queries.  A within-subject user study with 22 participants compared CARE to a baseline LLM chatbot.  16 out of 22 participants preferred CARE, and CARE was rated significantly higher in reducing cognitive load (x²(4) = 19.04, p = 0.001). This structured, multi-agent approach can guide AI practitioners in designing more effective and personalized conversational AI systems for complex tasks.  |
| DELTA: Dense Efficient Long-range 3D Tracking for any video (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24211) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.24211))| Sergey Tulyakov, Evangelos Kalogerakis, Chuang Gan, Peiye Zhuang, Tuan Duc Ngo | DELTA performs dense 3D tracking of every pixel in a video using a coarse-to-fine strategy.  The research aims to develop an efficient method for dense, long-range 3D motion tracking from monocular video.  The method leverages a joint global-local attention mechanism at reduced resolution for initial tracking, followed by an attention-based upsampler for high-resolution predictions.  On the Kubric 3D dataset, DELTA achieves 81.4% Average Jaccard (AJ) for 3D tracking, outperforming prior methods while being significantly faster. This provides AI practitioners with a computationally efficient and accurate method for dense 3D motion estimation, applicable to tasks requiring fine-grained motion analysis in videos.  |
| Learning Video Representations without Natural Videos (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24213) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.24213))| Yossi Gandelsman, Xinlei Chen, Xueyang Yu | This paper explores learning video representations using solely synthetic data and natural still images.  The research investigates whether natural videos are essential for training effective video representations.  The authors train VideoMAE models on a progression of synthetic video datasets with increasing complexity, alongside datasets of natural image crops.  A VideoMAE model pre-trained on synthetic videos with natural image crops achieves 91.3% accuracy on UCF101 action classification, matching the performance of a model pre-trained on UCF101 itself.  This suggests that AI practitioners may be able to train effective video models without large, curated natural video datasets, potentially simplifying data acquisition and addressing privacy or bias concerns.  |

| A Large Recurrent Action Model: xLSTM enables Fast Inference for Robotics Tasks (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22391) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.22391))| Korbinian Pöppel, Maximilian Beck, Vihang Patil, Thomas Adler, Thomas Schmied | Here's a concise summary of the AI research paper following your strict guidelines:  i) This paper investigates the suitability of modern recurrent architectures, particularly xLSTM, for building large action models (LAMs) to achieve fast inference in robotics.  ii) The main objective was to test the hypothesis that modern recurrent models are better suited for LAMs than Transformers regarding training and inference speed.  iii)  The researchers developed a Large Recurrent Action Model (LRAM) using xLSTM and trained it on a large-scale multi-domain dataset (894M transitions from 432 tasks) using a supervised learning setting similar to Decision Transformer.  iv) Experiments showed that xLSTM-based LRAMs outperformed Transformers in terms of both performance and speed across 432 tasks; specifically, on the 206M parameter models, xLSTM achieved better performance than Transformers and the inference time was significantly lower, with significantly reduced latency compared to Transformer-based models across different context lengths.  v)  The most impactful finding, the superior inference speed of xLSTM-based LRAMs, suggests that modern recurrent architectures offer a compelling alternative to Transformers for real-time robotic applications requiring fast inference.  The paper lacks information regarding the specific hardware used for the comparison of speed/latency.  |
| Stealing User Prompts from Mixture of Experts (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22884) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.22884))| Nicholas Carlini, Jamie Hayes, Ilia Shumailov, Itay Yona | This paper demonstrates a novel attack exploiting architectural flaws in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs to extract user prompts.  The research aimed to determine if an adversary could exploit Expert-Choice-Routing (ECR) in MoE models to disclose a victim's prompt when batched together.  The attack manipulated expert routing within a two-layer Mixtral model using crafted adversarial batches, triggering the ECR tie-breaker to leak information. In their evaluation, 99.9% (4833/4838) of the secret tokens across a test set of 1000 common English words were successfully recovered.  This vulnerability highlights the critical need for AI practitioners to consider prompt security and batch independence during the design and deployment of MoE-based LLMs.  |
| AutoMIR: Effective Zero-Shot Medical Information Retrieval without Relevance Labels (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20050) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.20050))| Xiao Zhou, Xiangxu Zhang, Lei Li, zl101 | This paper introduces SL-HyDE, a self-learning framework for zero-shot medical information retrieval.  The research aims to develop an effective dense retrieval system for medical information without requiring relevance-labeled training data.  The key methodology involves a self-learning framework that iteratively refines a large language model (LLM) for generating hypothetical documents and a dense retrieval model for document ranking.  SL-HyDE improved NDCG@10 by an average of 4.9% across ten datasets compared to HyDE (Qwen2 as generator + BGE as retriever).  This improvement suggests that AI practitioners can leverage SL-HyDE to develop more accurate medical information retrieval systems without the need for expensive and time-consuming manual annotation of relevance data.  |
| TokenFormer: Rethinking Transformer Scaling with Tokenized Model Parameters (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23168) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.23168))| Jan Eric Lenssen, Yongqin Xian, Muhammad Ferjad Naeem, Yue Fan, Haiyang Wang | TokenFormer introduces a fully attention-based architecture for scaling transformer models.  The research aims to address the high computational cost of scaling transformers, which traditionally requires retraining from scratch when architectural changes are made.  The core methodology replaces linear projections in transformers with a token-parameter attention layer, treating model parameters as tokens that interact with input tokens via attention.  Scaling TokenFormer from 124M to 1.4B parameters incrementally achieves a perplexity of 11.77, comparable to a transformer trained from scratch at 1.4B parameters but at significantly reduced training cost.  This allows AI practitioners to scale transformer models more efficiently by reusing pre-trained models and avoiding computationally expensive retraining from scratch.  |

| CLEAR: Character Unlearning in Textual and Visual Modalities (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18057) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18057))| Denis Bobkov, Boris Mikheev, Alexey Zhavoronkin, Dmitrii Korzh, therem | This research aims to evaluate machine unlearning (MU) techniques in multimodal large language models (MLLMs).  The authors introduce CLEAR, a synthetic dataset of fictitious individuals with associated images and text, and evaluate 10 adapted MU methods across textual, visual, and multimodal setups using metrics like ROUGE-L, probability score, truth ratio, and forget quality.  In multimodal unlearning on the CLEAR dataset using the LLaVa model, the SCRUB method maintained a retain metric of approximately 0.48 while achieving a forget metric of 0.36.  This suggests that current state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms struggle with multimodal setups, demonstrating the need for new approaches specifically designed for MLLMs. The paper also indicates that  L1 regularization on LoRA adapter weights can mitigate catastrophic forgetting.  Follow-up questions:  1.  How does the performance of the evaluated MU methods on the synthetic CLEAR dataset compare to performance on real-world multimodal datasets, and what modifications might be necessary for practical application? 2.  What is the computational cost of applying L1 regularization on LoRA weights during unlearning, and how does this impact the feasibility of applying this technique to larger MLLMs? 3.  Given the observed challenges in multimodal unlearning, what specific research directions might be most promising for developing more effective MMU algorithms, such as exploring alternative regularization techniques or novel architectural modifications?  |

The framework utilizes a phase-based workflow with five specialized agents (Reader, Planner, Developer, Reviewer, and Summarizer) combined with iterative debugging, unit testing, and a machine learning tools library.  In evaluations across eight Kaggle competitions, AutoKaggle achieved a valid submission rate of 0.83 using the GPT-40 model. This indicates the potential for multi-agent systems to automate complex data science workflows, achieving near-human-level performance. The paper does not explicitly state the performance metrics of the individual agents, which makes it difficult to assess their respective contributions.   Follow-up questions:  1.  Could the authors elaborate on the specific roles and interactions of each agent within the multi-agent system, and provide quantitative measures of their individual performance or contribution to the overall system performance? 2. How does the performance of AutoKaggle vary across different types of Kaggle competitions (e.g., classification vs. regression, different dataset sizes)? Are there certain competition characteristics where it performs particularly well or poorly, and why? 3.  What are the limitations of the current machine learning tools library, and what future extensions or improvements are planned to enhance its capabilities and address the observed debugging challenges related to feature engineering tools?  |

Greedy Segment Prompt Optimization (GSPO) automatically tunes the SocialPrompt using gradient information at the segment level.  c) **Results:** SocialGPT with Vicuna-13B and GSPO achieved 69.23% accuracy on the PIPA dataset, exceeding the prior state-of-the-art TRGAT by 1.4%.  d) **Implication:**  AI practitioners can leverage SocialGPT as a strong zero-shot baseline for social relation recognition, utilizing the power of pre-trained VFMs and LLMs while benefiting from GSPO for automatic prompt optimization and enhanced performance. The paper mentions additional benefits of interpretability of results and generalization to novel image styles but does not provide supporting quantitative details.  **Follow-up Questions:**  1. How does the performance of GSPO compare to other prompt optimization methods on social relation recognition tasks, particularly those not relying on segment-level optimization?  2.  What are the computational costs and time complexities of GSPO, particularly concerning the number of segments and candidate prompts?  3. The paper claims generalization to novel image styles. What is the quantifiable performance on these styles (e.g. sketch, cartoon) compared to existing models and in what domains or use cases are these improvements most significant?  |
| OpenWebVoyager: Building Multimodal Web Agents via Iterative Real-World Exploration, Feedback and Optimization (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19609) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.19609))| Hongming Zhang, Wenhao Yu, Kaixin Ma, Wenlin Yao, Hongliang He | This research aims to develop an open-source, multimodal web agent capable of improving its performance through iterative real-world exploration and feedback.  The methodology involves imitation learning from a GPT-40-based agent, followed by cycles of self-exploration, GPT-40 feedback, and optimization using the Idefics2-8b-instruct LMM.  On the WebVoyager test set, the agent's task success rate increased from 19.9% after imitation learning to 25.8% after three optimization cycles. This suggests that iterative optimization with real-world feedback can improve open-source, multimodal web agent performance. The paper does not detail the computation resources or time required for training or optimization.   Follow-up Questions:  1. What were the specific hyperparameter settings used for fine-tuning Idefics2-8b-instruct during both the imitation learning and iterative optimization phases?  2.  How does the performance of OpenWebVoyager compare to closed-source multimodal models like GPT-4V on more complex web navigation tasks not included in the evaluated datasets? 3. What is the breakdown of successes and failures attributed to visual understanding versus textual understanding limitations within the agent?  |
| Flow-DPO: Improving LLM Mathematical Reasoning through Online Multi-Agent Learning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22304) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.22304))| Paul Mineiro, ydeng9 | a) This research aims to improve the quality of reasoning traces generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) for mathematical problem-solving.  b) The proposed method uses an online learning Flow comprising multiple LLMs that collaboratively construct solutions, trained via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with rollouts.  c) Using flow-generated reasoning traces for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) led to an accuracy of 71.3% on GSM8K and 27.8% on MATH for Llama-3-8B-Instruct, outperforming SFT with self-generated and ground-truth traces.  d) AI practitioners can use online-learned multi-agent Flows to generate superior reasoning traces for LLM fine-tuning, leading to improved performance in complex reasoning tasks. The paper highlights the impact of flow-generated reasoning traces for improving single-model SFT performance in math problem-solving, offering a new approach to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities.  Follow-up questions:  1. What are the computational resource requirements (e.g., GPU hours, memory) for training the flow and performing SFT with the proposed method compared to baseline methods? 2.  How does the chunk size parameter affect the performance and training efficiency of the Flow, and what strategies can be used for optimizing this parameter? 3. Could this approach be generalized to other reasoning tasks beyond mathematics, such as commonsense reasoning or logical deduction?  |
| ShadowKV: KV Cache in Shadows for High-Throughput Long-Context LLM Inference (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21465) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.21465))| Ningxin Zheng, Size Zheng, Wenlei Bao, Li-Wen Chang, preminstrel | a) The research aimed to improve the throughput of long-context large language model (LLM) inference, which is hampered by the growing memory footprint and access needs of the key-value (KV) cache.  b) SHADOWKV, a proposed system, stores a low-rank representation of the pre-Rotary Position Embedding (pre-RoPE) key cache on the GPU, offloads the value cache to the CPU, and employs a chunk-based approximation method with outlier detection for sparse attention during decoding.  c)  On an A100 GPU, SHADOWKV achieved up to a 3.04× throughput increase for Llama-3.1-8B with a batch size of 122K context length samples, surpassing the theoretical throughput of an infinite batch size under the assumption of infinite GPU memory.  d) AI practitioners can leverage SHADOWKV to significantly improve the serving efficiency of long-context LLMs without substantial accuracy degradation by reducing the KV cache's memory footprint and optimizing sparse attention mechanisms.   Follow-up questions:  1. What are the practical considerations and potential trade-offs involved in implementing the low-rank approximation and value offloading strategy for different hardware configurations (e.g., systems with limited CPU memory or varying PCIe bandwidth)?  2.  How does SHADOWKV's chunk-based KV selection method compare to other sparse attention techniques in terms of computational complexity and robustness to different LLM architectures and tasks? 3.  Is the code publicly available, and what level of technical expertise is required to integrate SHADOWKV into existing LLM serving pipelines?  |
| Robots Pre-train Robots: Manipulation-Centric Robotic Representation from Large-Scale Robot Dataset (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22325) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.22325))| Yongyuan Liang, Huanyu Li, Tao Huang, Yifei Sun, Guangqi Jiang | This research investigates whether manipulation-centric visual representations improve robot learning.  The authors propose Manipulation Centric Representation (MCR), which pre-trains a visual encoder on the DROID robotic dataset and incorporates dynamics information (robot actions and proprioceptive states) via a novel contrastive loss, an action prediction loss, and a time contrastive loss.  Across four simulated robotic manipulation domains, MCR outperforms the strongest baseline by 14.8% in terms of average success rate. The most impactful finding is the strong correlation between “manipulation centricity,” the representation’s ability to focus on manipulation-relevant regions, and downstream task performance. This implies that AI practitioners can improve robot learning efficiency by designing representations that prioritize manipulation-relevant information.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does the choice of pre-trained backbone architecture (ResNet vs. ViT) influence the effectiveness of MCR and its manipulation centricity? 2.  Could MCR be adapted for other robotic tasks beyond manipulation, such as navigation or grasping, and if so, how might the pre-training objectives need to be modified? 3. What are the limitations of using Grad-CAM to measure manipulation centricity, and are there alternative, potentially more robust methods for evaluating this characteristic?  |
| Precise and Dexterous Robotic Manipulation via Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21845) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.21845))| Sergey Levine, Jeffrey Wu, charlesxu0124, jianlanluo | a) This research aims to develop a reinforcement learning (RL) system for vision-based robotic manipulation capable of acquiring diverse dexterous skills in real-world settings.  b) The system, HIL-SERL, uses a sample-efficient off-policy RL algorithm (RLPD) with a pretrained visual backbone, incorporates human demonstrations and corrections, and employs a sparse reward function based on a trained binary classifier.  c) HIL-SERL achieves a 100% success rate on nearly all evaluated tasks within 1 to 2.5 hours of real-world training, representing an average 101% improvement in success rate and 1.8x faster cycle time compared to imitation learning baselines trained with an equivalent amount of human data.  d) The results indicate that carefully designed RL systems can enable real-world acquisition of complex vision-based manipulation policies within practical training times, exceeding imitation learning and potentially unlocking wider application of robots in complex manipulation tasks.  The most impactful finding is the high success rate achieved in short training times, highlighting the potential of RL for real-world robotics applications previously considered infeasible.   Follow-up questions:  1.  How does the system's performance vary with different pretrained visual backbones, and are there ways to optimize backbone selection for specific manipulation tasks?  2.  What are the limitations of the current human correction interface (SpaceMouse), and how could more intuitive and efficient interfaces enhance performance and broaden the range of correctible errors?  3.  While the paper mentions the lack of extensive randomization and tests in unstructured environments, how could these be incorporated into future research to validate the generalizability and deployability of HIL-SERL in real-world scenarios?  |

The authors adapted the Mistral 7B v0.1 model and further pre-trained it on a curated dataset of Polish and English texts, incorporating techniques like Weighted Instruction Cross-Entropy Loss and Adaptive Learning Rate.  Evaluation on the Open PL LLM Leaderboard showed a 9 percentage point improvement over Mistral-7B-v0.1 on the RAG Reader task. This implies that adapting and further training existing multilingual models can significantly improve performance for specific languages.

The key methodology involved creating AgentStore, a platform with an AgentPool of specialized agents, an AgentEnroll protocol for adding new agents, and a MetaAgent using an AgentToken strategy to manage and select agents for task execution.  On the OSWorld benchmark, AgentStore achieved a 23.85% success rate, more than doubling the previous best system's performance (11.21%).  This implies that for AI practitioners, integrating specialized agents significantly enhances agent systems in both generalization and specialization for complex, open-ended computer tasks. The paper does not provide details about the training data or the agent integration protocol, stating they will be available when the project is open-sourced.   Follow-up questions:  1. What is the specific architecture of the MetaAgent, including details about its multimodal processing capabilities and how it integrates the system state information? 2. Can you elaborate on the agent integration protocol, specifically the format and content of the document developers need to provide during AgentEnroll? 3.

Follow-up questions:  1. What specific techniques were used in post-training to align the voice model to ideal completions and prevent unauthorized voice generation? 2. How does GPT-40's performance on non-English languages compare to its performance on English across other modalities besides text, such as image and video understanding? 3.

| Document Parsing Unveiled: Techniques, Challenges, and Prospects for Structured Information Extraction (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21169) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.21169))| Zhengren Wang, Junyuan Zhang, Bin Wang, Victor Shea-Jay Huang, Qintong Zhang | This paper surveys document parsing techniques for extracting structured information from various document formats. The authors review both modular pipeline systems, comprised of layout analysis, content extraction, and relation integration stages, and end-to-end approaches using vision-language models (VLMs).  The survey consolidates commonly used datasets, like PubLayNet for layout analysis and ICDAR for OCR, and associated evaluation metrics, including IoU for layout analysis and character error rate for text recognition.  While lacking quantitative comparisons between the modular and VLM approaches, the authors highlight the emerging trend of unified frameworks and universal OCR paradigms exemplified by models like GOT, which achieved performance improvements on complex charts and non-traditional content.  This suggests that VLMs offer a promising path towards more general and efficient document parsing solutions.  Follow-up Questions:  1.  Given the limitations discussed for both modular systems and VLMs, what specific strategies (e.g., architectural changes, training techniques) could be most effective for improving the performance of VLMs on high-density text and complex table structures found in document images? 2.  What are the comparative computational resource requirements (training time, memory, inference speed) of modular systems and end-to-end VLM approaches for document parsing, and how do these impact practical deployment considerations? 3.  While GOT demonstrates a promising universal OCR approach, how effectively does it generalize to diverse document types and languages beyond the datasets mentioned in the paper, and what further research is needed to assess its real-world applicability across different domains?  |

Follow-up questions:  1.  What is the computational cost of using LongReward, particularly with respect to the number of API calls to the judge LLM, and how can this be optimized for practical deployment? 2.  How does the choice of the "off-the-shelf" LLM used as the judge in LongReward affect the performance and biases of the final trained long-context LLM? 3.  Could LongReward be adapted for other RL algorithms beyond DPO, and what might be the potential benefits or drawbacks of such adaptations?  |
| DreamClear: High-Capacity Real-World Image Restoration with Privacy-Safe Dataset Curation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18666) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18666))| Xiaotian Han, Huaibo Huang, Xiaoqiang Zhou, Yuang Ai, Ye27 | This research aims to improve real-world image restoration (IR) by addressing dataset limitations and developing a high-capacity model.  The authors introduce GenIR, a privacy-preserving data pipeline using text-to-image diffusion models and multimodal large language models to generate a synthetic dataset of one million high-quality images. They then present DreamClear, a Diffusion Transformer-based IR model incorporating degradation priors via a Mixture of Adaptive Modulator (MoAM).  On the LSDIR-Val benchmark, DreamClear achieves a 0.3836 LPIPS score.  This work offers practitioners a method for creating large-scale, privacy-safe IR datasets and a high-performing model leveraging diffusion and degradation priors.  Follow-up questions:  1. What are the specific architectural details and hyperparameters of the routing network (R) within the MoAM module, and how were these determined? 2. While the paper mentions model distillation and quantization as potential solutions for improving inference speed, are there any specific experiments or preliminary results demonstrating the effectiveness of these methods on DreamClear? 3. Could the GenIR pipeline be adapted for other vision tasks beyond image restoration, and what modifications might be necessary for such adaptations?  |
| MarDini: Masked Autoregressive Diffusion for Video Generation at Scale (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20280) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.20280))| Yanping Xie, Mengmeng Xu, Zijian Zhou, Shikun Liu, Haozhe Liu | a) The research aimed to develop a scalable and efficient video generation model that combines the flexibility of masked autoregressive (MAR) modeling with the stability of diffusion models (DMs).  b) MarDini uses an asymmetric architecture with a MAR planning model operating on low-resolution inputs to generate planning signals, and a lightweight DM generating high-resolution frames conditioned on these signals and unmasked frames.  A progressive training strategy with increasing task difficulty (from video interpolation to image-to-video generation) and resolution was employed.  c) MarDini-L/T achieved an FVD score of 117.13 on the DAVIS-7 video interpolation benchmark, surpassing previous methods.  The paper does not explicitly report results for image-to-video generation on VBench without motion score guidance.  d) AI practitioners can leverage MarDini's architecture and training strategy to develop efficient and scalable video generation models trained from scratch without relying on generative image pre-training, enabling the creation of long-term video interpolations, video expansions, and image-to-video animations using a single model.  The paper does not provide sufficient detail to assess general image-to-video generation performance compared to state-of-the-art, only reporting a subset of the evaluated VBench metrics.  Follow-up Questions:  1.  Could you elaborate on the specific implementation details of the "Identity Attention" mechanism and quantify its impact on training stability across different model sizes and resolutions? 2. How does MarDini’s performance on standard image-to-video generation tasks (with full motion score guidance) compare to state-of-the-art models on VBench? The paper references improved "physical principles" but doesn't quantify this, and it only compares MarDini to other methods on a subset of VBench’s metrics.  3.  What are the limitations of the current progressive training scheme, and how can it be further optimized for even greater scalability and efficiency in terms of both training time and resource utilization?  |
| A Survey of Small Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20011) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.20011))| Samyadeep Basu, Yu Xia, Ryan Aponte, Xuan Shen, Chien Van Nguyen | a) This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Small Language Models (SLMs), focusing on their architectures, training techniques, and model compression methods. b) The authors propose a novel taxonomy categorizing SLM optimization methods based on the techniques used (pre-processing, training, post-processing) and the constraints addressed (inference compute, training time, etc.).   c) MobileBERT achieved a 4.3x size reduction and a 5.5x speedup compared to the base version of BERT. d)  AI practitioners can utilize this taxonomy and the survey's summary of existing techniques to select appropriate methods for developing and deploying SLMs under specific resource constraints.  Follow-up questions:  1.  While the survey mentions trade-offs between optimization goals, are there any quantitative analyses or specific examples that illustrate these trade-offs (e.g., memory-efficient training vs. inference speed)? 2.  The paper mentions neural architecture search (NAS) for SLMs.  Are there recommended NAS methods or tools specifically suited for the scale and characteristics of SLMs, and how do they compare in terms of computational cost and effectiveness? 3. How does data privacy for small language models compare to data privacy for large language models with the same underlying architecture, i.e. is privacy "easier" with small language models because less data is available to analyze for extraction of personal or protected data?  |
| GrounDiT: Grounding Diffusion Transformers via Noisy Patch Transplantation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20474) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.20474))| Minhyuk Sung, Taehoon Yoon, Phillip Y. Lee | a) This research aims to develop a training-free spatial grounding technique for text-to-image generation using Diffusion Transformers (DiT) that allows for precise control over object placement within user-specified bounding boxes.  b) The proposed method, GrounDiT, employs a two-stage denoising process: a global update based on cross-attention map alignment with bounding boxes and a local update involving the cultivation and transplantation of noisy image patches, leveraging DiT's "semantic sharing" property.  c) On the HRS benchmark, GrounDiT achieves 45.01% spatial accuracy, a +14.87% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art training-free method (R&B).  d) AI practitioners can use GrounDiT to enhance user controllability in text-to-image generation with DiT models by achieving fine-grained spatial grounding without model retraining.  This enables more precise object placement and layout control for various applications like image editing and compositional image generation.    Follow-up questions:  1.  The paper mentions increased computational cost due to separate object branches.  How does this cost scale with the number of bounding boxes, and what are the practical implications for real-time applications? 2.

Follow-up questions:  1. How does the choice of rejection rate (α) affect the trade-off between computational cost and final reward score across different LLM architectures and reward model complexities?  2. Could the performance of Speculative Rejection be further improved by incorporating prompt-dependent adaptive rejection rates or by using reward models trained as value functions?  3.

| Language Models And A Second Opinion Use Case: The Pocket Professional (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20636) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.20636))| David Noever | This research investigated the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) as second opinion tools in complex medical and legal scenarios.  The study analyzed LLM performance on 183 challenging medical cases from Medscape and 21 Supreme Court cases, comparing responses to crowd-sourced physician and published judicial decisions, respectively.  Foundational LLMs achieved >81% accuracy on straightforward medical cases but only 43% accuracy on complex medical cases, compared to consensus human expert answers.  This disparity suggests that while LLMs excel in information retrieval and structured scenarios, they currently struggle with the nuanced reasoning required for complex, real-world problem-solving. The paper doesn't specify details of the LLM prompting or fine-tuning strategies used.   Follow-up questions:  1. What specific prompting strategies were employed to elicit detailed reasoning and alternative diagnoses from the LLMs, and how did prompt engineering influence performance, particularly in ambiguous cases? 2. How did the inclusion of visual data (for the subset of cases with imaging) affect LLM performance across different models, and were there specific image processing or multimodal fusion techniques employed to integrate this information? 3. What specific metrics beyond accuracy, such as F1-score, precision, and recall, were used to evaluate LLM performance, especially in cases with multiple viable diagnoses?  |

The most impactful finding is the significant improvement in sample efficiency,  directly addressing the practical challenge of limited real-world robotic data.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does the computational cost of SGRv2 compare to other methods like RVT and PerAct, especially considering the use of point-wise predictions and weighted averaging?  2. Could the concept of action locality and the techniques employed in SGRv2 be generalized to other robotic tasks beyond manipulation, such as navigation or multi-agent scenarios?  3. While the paper demonstrates robustness to visual distractors, how robust is SGRv2 to variations in the physical properties of the environment, such as changes in friction or object weight?  |

The authors introduce "visual-temporal context prompting," a communication protocol where VLMs provide object segmentations and interaction types to a low-level policy (ROCKET-1), which then predicts actions.  In Minecraft experiments, ROCKET-1 combined with a Molmo 72B reasoner achieved a 91% success rate on the “place oak door on the diamond block” task, outperforming language- and image-based prompting baselines. This suggests that visual-temporal context prompting is an effective way to leverage the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs for embodied AI tasks.  The paper lacks specific details about the training dataset size and composition beyond mentioning using OpenAI’s Contractor dataset.  Follow-up questions:  1. What are the specific architectural details and hyperparameters of the causal transformer used in ROCKET-1, and how were these parameters tuned? 2.  How robust is the system to noisy or incomplete segmentation masks, and what strategies could be employed to mitigate the impact of such imperfections during real-world deployment? 3.  Beyond Minecraft, how generalizable is the visual-temporal prompting approach to other embodied AI tasks and environments, particularly those with continuous action spaces?  |

They evaluate three SALAD variants (Text2Acoustic, Semantic2Acoustic Autoregressive, Semantic2Acoustic Non-Autoregressive), along with corresponding discrete baseline models using RVQ.  c)  SALAD's Text2Acoustic (T2A) continuous model achieved the lowest character error rate (CER) of 0.739% on the LibriSpeech test-clean dataset, suggesting superior intelligibility. Subjective listening tests showed comparable quality and speaker similarity to ground truth for several models.  d) AI practitioners working on TTS systems may consider exploring continuous latent diffusion models like SALAD, particularly for applications prioritizing intelligibility. The findings suggest competitive performance with existing discrete methods and the potential for improved performance in certain aspects.   Follow-up questions:  1. What is the computational cost difference between the continuous diffusion approach and the discrete RVQ-based methods, both during training and inference? This would be crucial for practical deployment considerations.  2. How sensitive is SALAD's performance to the choice of VAE architecture and bottleneck dimension?  Exploring the trade-off between reconstruction quality and generation performance would be beneficial.  3. Could the authors elaborate on the limitations of using likelihood or confidence measures with the diffusion approach, and potential alternative solutions for decoding strategies beyond random token unmasking in the NAR model?  This could open avenues for further optimization.  |

They then trained a 2-billion parameter VLM, Aquila-VL-2B, using a curriculum learning approach.  c) Aquila-VL-2B achieved state-of-the-art performance among similar-sized models, scoring 54.9 on MMStar, a benchmark for multimodal understanding. An ablation study confirmed the positive impact of the synthetic data on model performance.  d) AI practitioners can leverage large-scale, high-quality instruction datasets like Infinity-MM and synthetic data generation methods to improve the performance of open-source VLMs, potentially reducing reliance on closed-source models or proprietary data.

The paper's most impactful finding is the significant performance improvement of the specialized PULSE MLLM over existing general-purpose MLLMs, demonstrating the potential of fine-tuning for domain-specific medical image analysis.  Follow-up questions:  1.  What specific vision encoder architecture and pre-training dataset were used for the PULSE model, and how did these choices impact performance compared to other open-source vision encoders? 2.

Does FasterCache impact the diversity of generated videos?  |
| MMAU: A Massive Multi-Task Audio Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19168) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.19168))| Ramaneswaran Selvakumar, Ashish Seth, Sonal Kumar, Utkarsh Tyagi, S Sakshi | MMAU aims to evaluate advanced audio perception and reasoning in AI models.  The benchmark uses 10,000 audio clips paired with multiple-choice questions spanning speech, sound, and music, requiring models to demonstrate 27 distinct skills.  Evaluation of 18 large audio-language models (LALMs) revealed that even the best-performing model achieved only 53% accuracy, significantly below human performance (82%).  Analysis showed that models struggled most with perceptual understanding of audio. The key implication for AI practitioners is the need for significant improvements in audio perception and reasoning capabilities of LALMs to achieve human-level performance in complex audio tasks.  Follow-up questions:  1. What specific architectural changes or training strategies could be explored to address the identified perceptual limitations in LALMs? 2. How can the MMAU benchmark be expanded to include more open-ended tasks that better reflect real-world audio understanding scenarios? 3. What are the potential downstream applications of improved LALM performance on the MMAU benchmark, specifically in areas like human-computer interaction and audio content analysis?  |

The demonstrated impact of tokenization highlights its often-overlooked role in realizing the theoretical reasoning capabilities of LLMs.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the performance improvement from delimiter-based tokenization scale with increasingly large input strings and more complex counting scenarios beyond single letter counts?  2.  Given the observed impact, what specific tokenization algorithms or modifications to existing methods could be explored to further enhance LLMs' reasoning abilities in practical applications?  3.  Does the impact of tokenization on counting ability generalize to other, non-English languages, and if so, are there language-specific tokenization strategies that could be particularly beneficial?  |
| Fictitious Synthetic Data Can Improve LLM Factuality via Prerequisite Learning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19290) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.19290))| Yang Zhang, Tommi Jaakkola, code-terminator, yujianll | PREREQ-TUNE, a novel fine-tuning strategy, aims to reduce LLM hallucinations by disentangling knowledge and skill acquisition.  The method introduces a prerequisite learning stage to teach an LLM task-relevant knowledge via a knowledge LoRA, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train a skill LoRA focused solely on task performance.  Experiments on biography generation, medical question answering, and short question answering demonstrated that PREREQ-TUNE, trained with fictitious synthetic data, outperformed baselines, improving factuality (achieving 74.35% accuracy on medical QA). Results also confirmed PREREQ-TUNE's disentanglement capabilities, preventing knowledge pollution.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does the performance of PREREQ-TUNE compare to other methods when scaling the size of real training data, rather than synthetic data? 2. Could the knowledge LoRA approach be adapted for real-time knowledge retrieval within a RAG framework, and what are the potential latency implications? 3.

A routing strategy then selects a combination of human and LLM annotations that maximizes the PPM’s predicted performance.  c)  Reward models trained on the hybrid datasets generated by the routing framework achieved a 7-13% absolute improvement on RewardBench compared to using either 100% human or 100% synthetic preferences.  d)  The study suggests that AI practitioners can optimize preference data collection by strategically routing instances to human annotators or LLMs, reducing annotation costs while improving the quality of trained reward models. The most impactful finding is that a hybrid approach, rather than relying solely on humans or LLMs, can substantially improve reward model performance.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does the performance of the routing framework and the resulting hybrid preferences vary with different LLMs used for both synthetic preference generation and as the base reward model?  2. Could the features used in the PPM be expanded to incorporate characteristics beyond text similarity and prompt metadata, such as user demographics or task difficulty, to further personalize the routing strategy?  3.  What are the practical implications for integrating this routing framework into existing RLHF pipelines, specifically addressing the challenges of real-time routing and the potential for feedback loops between the PPM, reward model, and policy model?  |
| Leveraging Skills from Unlabeled Prior Data for Efficient Online Exploration (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18076) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18076))| Sergey Levine, Kevin Frans, Qiyang Li, Max Wilcoxson | a) This research investigates how unlabeled prior trajectory data can be used to learn efficient exploration strategies in reinforcement learning (RL).  b) The proposed method, SUPE (Skills from Unlabeled Prior data for Exploration), extracts low-level skills from unlabeled trajectories using a variational autoencoder (VAE) and then uses an optimistic reward model to pseudo-label the trajectories for training a high-level off-policy RL agent to compose these skills.  c) SUPE outperforms baseline methods on a suite of long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks, achieving an average success rate of 25% after 300,000 environment steps on the antmaze-ultra task, compared to 17% for the next-best method.  d) AI practitioners can leverage unlabeled prior trajectory data to improve sample efficiency in online reinforcement learning, particularly in challenging exploration settings.  This allows quicker learning and potentially higher asymptotic performance compared to methods that do not leverage such prior data effectively.  Follow-up questions:  1.  The paper mentions potential instability of the KL penalty objective, particularly in the Kitchen domain. Could the authors elaborate on the specific nature of this instability and potential mitigation strategies beyond switching to the tanh policy parameterization?  2.  While the paper demonstrates the benefits of SUPE on several benchmark tasks, what are the limitations of this approach regarding the types of environments or tasks where it might be less effective?  For instance, how would SUPE perform in environments with highly stochastic transitions or where the prior data is significantly mismatched with the target task?  3. How sensitive is SUPE's performance to the quality of the learned low-level skills?  Are there specific metrics or analyses that could be used to assess the quality of these skills and their impact on the overall performance of the online learning phase?  |
| Dynamic 3D Gaussian Tracking for Graph-Based Neural Dynamics Modeling (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18912) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18912))| Yunzhu Li, Kaifeng Zhang, MingtongZ | This research aims to learn object dynamics directly from multi-view RGB videos for action-conditioned video prediction and model-based planning.  The methodology involves using a modified Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (Dyn3DGS) method for dense object tracking, followed by training a graph neural network (GNN) on sparse control particles to predict object motions under robot actions.  The proposed method achieves a Median Trajectory Error (MTE) of 6.90mm for ropes, 13.14mm for cloth, and 12.83mm for toy animals in 3D tracking, outperforming 2D and depth-based baselines. This implies AI practitioners can leverage this framework to develop more accurate and robust 3D dynamics models directly from video data, enabling applications like robotic manipulation and video prediction in 3D. The paper does not detail the architecture of the GNN used, which leaves a key methodological aspect unclear.  Follow-up questions:  1. What specific GNN architecture was used for the dynamics model, and how were its hyperparameters tuned?  Details on the GNN's design and training process would be valuable for replication and comparison to other architectures. 2. How does the computational cost of the proposed method scale with the number of Gaussians and the complexity of the object? This is critical for evaluating the feasibility of real-time applications. 3. How robust is the dense motion interpolation scheme to significant variations in Gaussian scale or distribution during object deformation, and how does this impact rendering quality?  Further details regarding the robustness to changes in Gaussian representation would be beneficial.  |
| Reflection-Bench: probing AI intelligence with reflection (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16270) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.16270))| Yan Teng, Shuqi Kong, Haiquan Zhao, Yixu Wang, LingyuLi | a) This research aims to evaluate the reflection capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), defined as the ability to adapt beliefs or behaviors based on unexpected outcomes.  b) The authors introduce Reflection-Bench, a benchmark comprising seven tasks adapted from cognitive science paradigms, including probabilistic reversal learning, Wisconsin card sorting test, and a meta-bandit task.  c)  Evaluation of 13 LLMs revealed varying performance levels, with o1-preview achieving the highest overall score, while all models scored zero on the meta-bandit task, indicating a lack of meta-reflection ability.  d)  AI practitioners should consider incorporating reflection-based benchmarks like Reflection-Bench to evaluate and enhance the adaptability and learning capabilities of LLMs, particularly for real-world applications requiring dynamic decision-making.   Follow-up Questions:  1. Given the observed limitations of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in the oddball paradigm and its high computational cost, what alternative strategies could be explored to improve LLMs' automatic surprise detection without compromising performance in other reflection tasks?  2.  How can the insights from the universal failure of LLMs on the meta-bandit task be leveraged to develop specific training methodologies or architectural modifications that foster meta-reflection capabilities?  3. Beyond accuracy, what other metrics could be introduced into Reflection-Bench to provide a more granular assessment of the internal processes underlying LLMs' reflection abilities, such as information processing and belief updating strategies?  |

| Breaking the Memory Barrier: Near Infinite Batch Size Scaling for Contrastive Loss (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17243) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.17243))| Kehan Li, Hang Zhang, LidongBing, Zhiqiang007, ClownRat | a) This research addresses the quadratic growth of GPU memory consumption when scaling batch sizes for contrastive loss, which limits performance gains.  b)  The paper proposes Inf-CL, a tile-based computation strategy that partitions the contrastive loss calculation, avoiding full materialization of the similarity matrix and leveraging a multi-level tiling approach across GPUs and CUDA cores.  c) Inf-CL enabled training a ViT-L/14 CLIP model with a batch size of 12M on 32 A800 80GB GPUs using only 1.44GB of memory per GPU.  d) AI practitioners can leverage Inf-CL to scale contrastive learning batch sizes to significantly larger values than previously possible, potentially improving model performance without incurring substantial memory overhead or significant speed reduction.   Follow-up questions:  1.  The paper mentions that excessively large batch sizes resulted in suboptimal performance in some cases.  What specific hyperparameter tuning strategies are recommended when scaling to these very large batch sizes enabled by Inf-CL? 2.  How does the performance of Inf-CL in other contrastive learning tasks (e.g., self-supervised learning, dense text retrieval) compare to its performance in image-text retrieval, and are there task-specific adaptations or optimizations needed?  |
| LOGO -- Long cOntext aliGnment via efficient preference Optimization (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18533) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18533))| Min Zhang, Qiaoming Zhu, Zechen Sun, douvleplus, ZetangForward | a) This research aims to improve the generation capability of long-context models (LCMs) to address misaligned outputs like hallucinations and instruction unfollowing.  b) The study introduces LOGO, a training strategy using reference-free preference optimization with a tailored data construction pipeline involving positional indices synthesis and automatic evaluation of chunk importance.  It modifies the SimPO objective to incorporate multiple dis-preference examples and an SFT regularization term.  c)  The Llama-3-8B-LOGO model, trained with LOGO, outperforms GPT-3.5-Turbo on real-world long-context tasks from LongBench and approaches the performance of GPT-4, showing a 5-point average improvement over the baseline Llama-3-8B-Instruct-80K.  d)  AI practitioners can use LOGO to fine-tune LCMs for improved generation performance in long-context tasks with reduced computational resources, potentially allowing for efficient context window scaling.   Follow-up questions:  1.  The paper mentions a lack of suitable evaluation models for detecting hallucinations.  What specific evaluations beyond NIAH and LongBench would provide more robust insights into the reduction of hallucinations with LOGO?  2.  The paper mentions adjusting the weighting of dis-preference samples as future work.  What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of weighting these samples differently, and how might this weighting be implemented in the LOGO objective function?  3. How does LOGO's performance compare to other long-context alignment methods in terms of inference speed and memory usage, especially when dealing with extremely long contexts?  |
| Unleashing Reasoning Capability of LLMs via Scalable Question Synthesis from Scratch (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18693) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18693))| Qiaoming Zhu, Xiaobo Liang, douvleplus, XinyuShi, dyyyyyyyy | This research aims to improve the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by developing a scalable and cost-effective data synthesis method.  The key methodology, ScaleQuest, uses smaller open-source LLMs to generate math questions from scratch, followed by filtering and response generation using larger models and reward filtering.  Fine-tuning Qwen2-Math-7B with the synthetic dataset resulted in a 73.4% accuracy on the MATH benchmark, matching GPT-4-Turbo's performance. This implies that AI practitioners can utilize ScaleQuest to create large-scale, high-quality training data for LLMs, potentially reducing reliance on expensive proprietary models and datasets.  The paper does not clearly specify the size of the final dataset used in the instruction tuning phase after filtering, which impacts the interpretability of the 1M figure.  Follow-up questions:  1. What are the specific details of the filtering process (e.g., thresholds, filtering model sizes) and how were these parameters determined? 2.  Could the authors provide more detail about the dataset size used in instruction tuning after filtering, as the paper mentions both 1M and seems to imply a smaller number in the filtering process description. How does performance vary with different dataset sizes generated by ScaleQuest? 3. How does ScaleQuest perform on other reasoning tasks beyond mathematics?  What modifications, if any, would be required to apply this method to other domains?   |
| Can Knowledge Editing Really Correct Hallucinations? (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16251) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.16251))| kaishu666, apayani, XiongxiaoXu, canyuchen, BaixHuang | a) The paper investigates whether knowledge editing techniques effectively correct factual hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs).  b) Researchers constructed HalluEditBench, a dataset of LLM-generated hallucinations spanning 9 domains and 26 topics, and evaluated seven knowledge editing techniques across five facets: Efficacy, Generalization, Portability, Locality, and Robustness.  c) While some methods like ICE and GRACE achieved high Efficacy scores (e.g., over 60% on Llama2-7b and Mistral-v0.3-7B), none consistently outperformed others across all five facets, and some even negatively impacted performance in areas like Generalization.  It was also observed that FT-M achieved only around 60% Efficacy on Llama2-7B and Mistral-v0.3-7B, despite near-perfect scores on existing datasets.  d) AI practitioners should exercise caution when relying on existing knowledge editing evaluation datasets, as their results may not reflect real-world hallucination correction effectiveness. The domain and LLM-specific nature of performance highlights the need for tailored editing strategies.  Follow-up questions:  1.  Given the domain-specific performance variations, what strategies can be employed to improve the generalization of knowledge editing techniques across different domains?  2.  What specific metrics or evaluation frameworks could better capture the holistic impact of knowledge editing, beyond simple accuracy on benchmark datasets, considering the trade-offs observed across Efficacy, Generalization, Portability, Locality, and Robustness?  3.  How can the limitations of parameter-preserving methods like ICE and GRACE regarding robustness be addressed while maintaining their high efficacy in correcting hallucinations?  |
| Unbounded: A Generative Infinite Game of Character Life Simulation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18975) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18975))| flavoredquark, mohitbansal, davejacobs, NealWadhwa, yzli | This research introduces the concept of a generative infinite game, aiming to create a video game with open-ended mechanics and narrative generated by AI.  The methodology combines a specialized distilled large language model (LLM) for real-time game logic and narrative generation with a novel dynamic regional image prompt Adapter (IP-Adapter) for consistent visual generation of characters and environments.  Results show improved character and environment consistency compared to existing approaches, with the distilled LLM achieving a 0.264 improvement in CLIP-IC for character consistency over Story Diffusion. This implies that AI practitioners can leverage distilled LLMs and regional IP-Adapters to create more dynamic and consistent generative games, moving beyond the limitations of traditional hard-coded systems. The paper does not quantify latency or frame rate for the "real-time" claim.   Follow-up questions:  1. What specific architectural details of the distilled LLM (beyond being based on Gemma-2B) contribute to its interactive speed, and how does its performance compare to larger LLMs in terms of both latency and resource consumption? 2.  How does the dynamic mask in the regional IP-Adapter contribute to the balance between preserving character details and incorporating environment style, and are there any observed trade-offs or limitations? 3. Can the regional IP-Adapter be generalized to other generative tasks beyond character life simulation, such as generating objects in diverse scenes for synthetic data generation?  |
| Framer: Interactive Frame Interpolation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18978) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18978))| Wen Wang, BiaoGong, Azily, zkcys001, qiuyuu | a) The research aims to develop an interactive frame interpolation framework that allows users to customize transitions between two images using point trajectory control, while also offering an automated "autopilot" mode.  b) Framer fine-tunes a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model with additional last-frame conditioning and incorporates a point trajectory controlling branch. An "autopilot" mode uses bi-directional point-tracking to estimate and refine trajectories automatically.  c) Framer outperforms existing video interpolation methods in user studies, achieving a 90.5% preference rate compared to other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating enhanced user control and visual quality.  d) AI practitioners can leverage Framer to create customized and high-quality video frame interpolations for applications like image morphing, slow-motion generation, and novel view synthesis, improving the controllability and creative potential of video editing and generation tasks.  The paper does not clearly define the specifics of how “Framer with Co-Tracker” differs from Framer in training or testing, although it reports superior performance for “Framer with Co-Tracker”.  Follow-up questions:  1. Could the bi-directional point tracking method used in "autopilot" mode be integrated into the interactive mode to provide users with suggested or refined trajectories, further enhancing the interactive experience?  2. How does the computational cost of Framer, particularly during inference with the diffusion model, compare to traditional frame interpolation techniques, and what are the implications for real-time applications?  3.  What are the specific architectural details and training procedures of “Framer with Co-Tracker”, and how do these differences contribute to the reported performance gains?  |
| Distill Visual Chart Reasoning Ability from LLMs to MLLMs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18798) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18798))| zifeishan, cnxup, zh2001, WooooDyy, hewei2001 | a) This research aims to improve visual chart reasoning abilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). b) The authors propose Code-as-Intermediary Translation (CIT), synthesizing chart-plotting code and using LLMs to generate reasoning-intensive questions and answers, creating the REACHQA dataset. c) Fine-tuning LLaVA-Next-Llama3-8B on REACHQA resulted in a 34.8% average performance improvement across multiple benchmarks. d)  AI practitioners can leverage CIT and synthetic datasets like REACHQA for cost-effective improvement of MLLMs' reasoning capabilities, generalizing beyond chart-specific tasks to broader multimodal reasoning.   Follow-up questions:  1. Could the CIT method be adapted to other visual domains beyond charts, and if so, what adaptations would be necessary? 2. How robust is the performance improvement from REACHQA across different MLLM architectures and sizes? 3.  What are the limitations of using synthetic data for training, and how can these limitations be addressed in future research?  |
| Why Does the Effective Context Length of LLMs Fall Short? (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18745) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18745))| Shansan Gong, Lei Li, Ming Zhong, Jun Zhang, Chenxin An | This research investigates why the effective context lengths of large language models (LLMs) often fall short of their trained lengths.  The authors introduce ShifTed Rotray position embeddING (STRING), a training-free method that shifts well-trained position indices to overwrite less-frequently encountered ones during inference.  On the Needle-in-a-Haystack (4-needle) benchmark, STRING improved the average score across seven LLMs by 18 points.  This suggests under-trained long-range position indices hinder LLM performance, and leveraging frequently-encountered indices can improve long-context processing without further training.  This provides AI practitioners with a readily implementable technique for enhancing the effective context utilization of existing LLMs.  Here are some follow-up questions an AI practitioner might have:  1. How does the choice of the shift offset (S) and local window (W) in STRING affect performance across different LLM architectures and sizes? 2. Does STRING impact other aspects of LLM performance, such as inference speed or memory usage, and how does this trade-off with the observed gains in effective context length? 3.  Could the insights about the left-skewed position frequency distribution inform improved training data generation strategies for LLMs to more effectively utilize the full context window during training itself?  |
| Robust Watermarking Using Generative Priors Against Image Editing: From Benchmarking to Advances (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18775) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18775))| Adams Wai-Kin Kong, Zihan Zhou, Yuanzhi, devSulyvahn, LUSHILIN | a) The research aims to develop a robust, invisible watermarking method for images that can withstand various image editing techniques, including those powered by text-to-image models.  b) The researchers introduce W-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating watermarking robustness against image editing, and propose VINE, a novel watermarking method that leverages blurring distortions as surrogate training attacks and adapts the SDXL-Turbo text-to-image model as a generative prior for the watermark encoder.  c) VINE-Robust achieves a True Positive Rate of 99.66% at a 0.1% False Positive Rate against image regeneration and 86.86% against global editing with InstructPix2Pix, outperforming existing methods.    d) AI practitioners developing image watermarking methods can utilize W-Bench to comprehensively evaluate robustness against a wider range of image editing techniques and consider incorporating generative priors and surrogate training attacks, as demonstrated by VINE, to enhance resilience.  e) The paper does not fully clarify the performance limitations of VINE with Image-to-Video generation, observing low overall detection rates but not providing extensive analysis or solutions.   Follow-up questions:  1. Given the computational cost of VINE, what optimization strategies could be explored to reduce inference time and GPU memory usage for real-time applications?  2. How does the choice of blurring distortions as surrogate attacks in VINE affect the robustness against specific image editing techniques not included in W-Bench, and how can this selection be tailored for different editing models?  3.  Could the insights from the frequency analysis of image editing in W-Bench be applied to improve the robustness of other watermarking techniques beyond VINE, such as those based on different network architectures or embedding strategies?  |
| Skywork-Reward: Bag of Tricks for Reward Modeling in LLMs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18451) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18451))| Jujie He, Rui Yan, Jiacai Liu, zengliangcs, chrisliu298 | a) This research aims to enhance reward modeling in LLMs, focusing on data-centric techniques for curating high-quality preference datasets.  b) The researchers curated the Skywork-Reward dataset (80K preference pairs) from existing public sources and trained discriminative reward models using the Bradley-Terry loss.  c)  The resulting Skywork-Reward-Gemma-2-27B model achieved state-of-the-art performance on RewardBench with an average score of 93.8 and a Chat Hard score of 91.4.  d)  This work demonstrates the importance of meticulous data selection and filtering for training effective reward models, suggesting that smaller, high-quality preference datasets can outperform larger, less curated ones. It shows that current best-in-class models can be improved significantly by focusing on dataset quality and selection and provides practical techniques for AI practitioners to improve LLM alignment through efficient reward modeling.   Follow-up questions:  1.  What specific filtering techniques were applied to the WildGuardMix dataset, and how did the two-stage filtering process contribute to the final performance?  The paper mentions a two-stage process but doesn't detail it.  2.  While the paper mentions experimenting with maximizing the margin between chosen and rejected responses using alternative loss functions, it doesn't provide details about the specific configurations used (e.g., margin values, hyperparameter settings for each loss). Providing this information would enable reproduction and further analysis.  3.  The paper highlights potential contamination in several datasets, including their own. What steps were taken to verify the nature of these overlaps (true contamination vs. misaligned preferences), and what is the long-term plan for maintaining dataset integrity as new training data becomes available?  |
| MotionCLR: Motion Generation and Training-free Editing via Understanding Attention Mechanisms (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18977) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18977))| Lei Zhang, Shunlin Lu, Xuan Ju, Wenxun Dai, Ling-Hao Chen | a) This research aims to develop a text-driven human motion generation model capable of interactive, fine-grained editing without retraining.  b) The researchers introduce MotionCLR, a diffusion-based model with a novel CLR block incorporating convolution, self-attention, cross-attention, and feed-forward network layers.  Cross-attention explicitly models word-level text-motion correspondence, while self-attention captures temporal coherence between motion frames.  c) MotionCLR achieves comparable generation performance to state-of-the-art methods, with an R-Precision of 0.544 for text-motion matching (Top 1) on the HumanML3D dataset. It also supports novel editing capabilities like motion (de-)emphasizing, in-place replacement, and sequence shifting through attention map manipulation.  d) AI practitioners can leverage MotionCLR’s attention mechanism analysis for more explainable and controllable motion generation, enabling interactive editing based on textual prompts or example motions without model retraining.  The specific roles of cross- and self-attention elucidated by this work can inform the design and development of other multi-modal generative models.   Follow-up questions:  1. What are the computational resource requirements (memory, processing power) for running MotionCLR inference, specifically for real-time editing applications?  2. How does the performance of the in-place motion replacement operation scale with the length and complexity of the motion sequences being edited?  3.  What specific strategies were used to mitigate the potential instability of manipulating attention maps, particularly when applying large weights for motion (de-)emphasis, and are there any limitations to the range of editable weights?  |
| Should We Really Edit Language Models? On the Evaluation of Edited Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18785) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18785))| Zeyu Li, Peijie Dong, Zhenheng Tang, Qi Li, Dominic789654 | a) The paper investigates how sequential model editing affects the general abilities of large language models (LLMs).  b)  Multiple LLMs were edited with various methods (ROME, MEMIT, PMET, MEND, KN, GRACE, SERAC) and evaluated on benchmarks assessing world knowledge, arithmetic, commonsense reasoning, reading comprehension, and safety.  c) After 10 edits on Llama2-7B using the KN method, the model failed to generate coherent, human-like text, demonstrating a “muting effect”; other methods preserved functionality at this level, though many showed performance degradation at higher edit counts.    d)  Current LLM editing methods are only suitable for small-scale knowledge updates (generally fewer than a few dozen), as larger-scale edits can disrupt intrinsic knowledge structures and compromise safety, even in aligned models.   Follow-up questions:  1.  Given the observed "muting effect" and performance degradation with increasing edits, what specific modifications to existing editing algorithms could improve their scalability and minimize negative impact on general LLM capabilities?  2. Beyond the benchmarks used in this paper, how would sequential editing affect performance on specific downstream tasks like named entity recognition, question answering, and natural language inference?  3. What are the practical implications of the observed safety degradation in edited models for real-world deployments, and what mitigation strategies could be employed to address these safety concerns?  |
| ADEM-VL: Adaptive and Embedded Fusion for Efficient Vision-Language Tuning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17779) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.17779))| Han Hu, Yong Luo, Li Shen, Jianyuan Guo, Zhiwei840 | a) **Objective:** To develop a more parameter- and computationally-efficient vision-language (VL) model fine-tuning framework for tasks like visual question answering and image captioning.  b) **Methodology:** The ADEM-VL framework modifies cross-attention modules within pretrained LLMs by replacing parameterized similarity measurements with a parameter-free approach using SiLU activation. It also incorporates multiscale visual features using pooling and an adaptive fusion scheme that discards less relevant visual features based on attention scores.  c) **Results:** On the ScienceQA dataset, ADEM-VL fine-tuned on LLaMA-13B achieved 94.55% average accuracy, outperforming existing methods by 0.77%. The paper also reports efficiency improvements in both training and inference times, but specific quantitative comparisons across all relevant baselines are not provided for these metrics.  d) **Implication for AI Practitioners:** ADEM-VL offers a more efficient method for fine-tuning VL models, potentially reducing computational costs and resource requirements for training and deploying these models, specifically concerning memory and inference speed.  **Follow-Up Questions:**  1.  The paper mentions efficiency gains but lacks comprehensive speed comparison data across PEFT baselines.  Could you elaborate on the inference speed improvement on ScienceQA compared to all mentioned baselines (LLaVA-LoRA, LaVIN, MemVP) using LLaMA-7B and 13B?  2.  How does the adaptive fusion scheme's performance vary across different datasets and tasks beyond ScienceQA and image captioning?  Are there tasks where dynamically dropping features might be detrimental?  3. What are the memory footprint reduction during training compared to other parameter-efficient methods when using LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B?  |
| CCI3.0-HQ: a large-scale Chinese dataset of high quality designed for pre-training large language models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18505) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18505))| Xiaofeng Shi, Hanyu Zhao, Chengwei Wu, Bo-Wen Zhang, ldwang | This research aimed to create a high-quality Chinese dataset for pre-training large language models (LLMs).  The researchers used a two-stage filtering pipeline, involving fundamental processing (e.g., safety filtering, deduplication) and high-quality processing using Qwen2-72B-instruct and a trained 0.5B classifier.  A 0.5B LLM trained on CCI3.0-HQ achieved an average score of 0.395 on a mixed dataset evaluation (60% English, 10% code, 30% Chinese) and 0.350 on a purely Chinese dataset, outperforming models trained on comparable datasets like SkyPile and WanjuanV1.  This provides AI practitioners with a new high-quality Chinese dataset, CCI3.0-HQ, for pre-training and benchmarking Chinese LLMs.   Follow-up questions:  1. What is the specific data mixture used in the 100B token training set for the Chinese Dataset Experiment besides the named datasets (Wanjuan-v1, SkyPile, CCI3.0, and CCI3.0-HQ)? The paper mentions the inclusion of these datasets but does not specify the proportions or any additional data. 2. How does the performance of the CCI3.0-HQ classifier compare to other quality classifiers on specific categories of positive samples, such as news articles, scientific literature, or social media posts? This could inform selection based on downstream tasks. 3.  What specific hardware resources (e.g., number of GPUs, type of GPUs, RAM) and how much time was required for training the 0.5B LLM model on 100B tokens with the different dataset compositions? This information would help other researchers estimate the computational resources required for similar experiments.  |
| CAMEL-Bench: A Comprehensive Arabic LMM Benchmark (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18976) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18976))| Ines Riahi, Ali Alharthi, Omkar Thawakar, Sara Ghaboura, ahmedheakl | a) The research aimed to create a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Arabic Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) across diverse domains.  b)  The researchers curated a dataset, CAMEL-Bench, with 29,036 questions across eight domains (e.g., multimodal understanding and reasoning, medical image understanding) and 38 sub-domains, using translated and manually verified data from various sources and GPT-40 generated questions.  They then evaluated several closed and open-source LMMs using metrics including exact match accuracy, edit distance, and fuzzy evaluation.  c) GPT-4o achieved the highest performance across most domains, with an accuracy of 73.57% on chart and diagram understanding tasks, highlighting the general superiority of closed-source models while also revealing that even the best-performing models struggle with Arabic multimodal data.  d) AI practitioners developing or deploying LMMs for Arabic should consider CAMEL-Bench as a crucial evaluation tool, given the demonstrated need for substantial improvement in Arabic LMM performance across various tasks, even for leading closed-source models.  The benchmark's diverse domains highlight specific areas needing improvement.  Follow-up questions:  1. What are the specific prompts used with GPT-40 to generate the multiple-choice questions for the dataset, and how could these prompts be refined to target specific aspects of Arabic linguistic understanding or cultural context?  2.  Could the researchers provide more details on the "fuzzy evaluation" methodology employed with GPT-4o, specifically regarding the prompt design and parameters used for comparing predicted and ground-truth answers in context?  How reproducible is this approach, and what are its limitations?  |
| WAFFLE: Multi-Modal Model for Automated Front-End Development (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18362) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18362))| Lin Tan, Shangshu Qian, jiang719, shanchao | This research aims to improve automated front-end development by addressing challenges in translating UI design images to HTML code. The authors introduce WAFFLE, a fine-tuning pipeline utilizing structure-aware attention and contrastive learning on multi-modal large language models (MLLMs).  On the WebSight-Test benchmark, WAFFLE achieved up to a 9.00 percentage point increase in HTML Match compared to standard fine-tuning methods. This suggests that WAFFLE improves the MLLM's understanding of HTML structure and visual details in UI images, facilitating more accurate code generation.  AI practitioners can leverage WAFFLE to improve the performance of UI-to-HTML generation models.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the performance of WAFFLE compare to existing UI-to-HTML generation methods on real-world, complex UI designs beyond the Design2Code dataset? 2.  What are the computational resource requirements for training and deploying WAFFLE with different backbone MLLMs?  3.  How does the choice of hyperparameters, such as the portion of attention heads using structure-aware attention and the contrastive learning weight (λ), impact performance and training stability across different datasets and MLLM architectures?  |
| Language Models are Symbolic Learners in Arithmetic (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15580) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.15580))| Hanjie Chen, Ruidi Chang, Roy Xie, Zhiqi Li, Chunyuan Deng | a) This research investigates whether large language models (LLMs) utilize partial products in arithmetic calculations or function as symbolic learners.  b) The study employed fine-tuning experiments on open-source LLMs (Gemma-2-2B and Llama-3.1-8B) with diagnostic tasks related to four multiplication algorithms and various rule and format perturbations. c) LLMs showed improved identification of partial products after fine-tuning on multiplication (+17.45% for standard multiplication), but fine-tuning on partial products did *not* improve multiplication performance; instead, position-level accuracy followed a U-shaped curve, suggesting an easy-to-hard subgroup selection based on subgroup quality. d) The paper implies that AI practitioners should consider LLMs as symbolic pattern matchers rather than calculators, focusing on subgroup complexity and selection when designing or analyzing arithmetic tasks for LLMs.    Follow-up Questions:  1.  Could incorporating explicit subgroup identification and training during fine-tuning improve the performance of LLMs on arithmetic tasks, particularly for the more difficult middle digits? 2.  How does the observed symbolic learning behavior in arithmetic tasks generalize to other symbolic reasoning domains, such as logical inference or program synthesis? 3.  Given the U-shaped accuracy curve, what specific curriculum learning strategies or training data augmentations could be most effective for improving LLM performance on arithmetic tasks across all digit positions?  |
| Stable Consistency Tuning: Understanding and Improving Consistency Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18958) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18958))| Hongsheng Li, Gsunshine, wangfuyun | a) The paper investigates the limitations of current consistency training/tuning methods for generative models, particularly training variance and discretization error, aiming to improve performance and convergence speed.  b) The authors propose Stable Consistency Tuning (SCT), building on Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT), which incorporates a variance-reduced training target via the score identity, a smoother progressive training schedule, and edge-skipping multistep inference.  c) SCT achieves improved FID scores, demonstrated by a 2-step FID of 1.55 on ImageNet-64, a new state-of-the-art result for consistency models.  d) AI practitioners can utilize SCT to train consistency models more efficiently and achieve higher-quality image generation with fewer sampling steps compared to existing methods.  The paper also demonstrates the effectiveness of classifier-free guidance for consistency models, which could be valuable for practitioners working on conditional generation tasks.   Follow-up questions:  1.  How does the computational cost of calculating the variance-reduced training target in SCT compare to the standard consistency training/tuning target, and how does this trade-off impact overall training time?  2.  The paper mentions adapting the variance-reduced score estimation for text-to-image generation using CLIP similarity, but leaves this for future study. How feasible is this adaptation, and what are the potential challenges in estimating probabilities based on CLIP similarity for conditional text-to-image generation using SCT?  3. Could the edge-skipping multistep inference strategy be applied to other generative model architectures beyond consistency models, and if so, what modifications would be required?  |
| Taipan: Efficient and Expressive State Space Language Models with Selective Attention (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18572) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18572))| Hanieh Deilamsalehy, Ruiyi Zhang, Thang M. Pham, Huy Huu Nguyen, chiennv | a) The research aimed to develop a language model that efficiently handles long sequences while maintaining strong performance in memory-intensive tasks like in-context retrieval.  b)  The authors introduced Taipan, a hybrid architecture combining Mamba-2 (a State Space Model) with Selective Attention Layers (SALs) that strategically apply attention to key tokens identified by a gating network, while other tokens bypass the attention mechanism.  c) Taipan outperformed Transformer, Mamba-2, and Jamba baselines in zero-shot language modeling and in-context retrieval tasks across different scales (190M, 450M, and 1.3B parameters).  The 1.3B parameter Taipan model achieved an average score of 53.3 across Winograd, PIQA, HellaSwag, ARC-easy, ARC-challenge, OpenbookQA, TruthfulQA, RACE, and BoolQ, exceeding other models at the same scale.  d) Taipan offers AI practitioners a more efficient alternative to Transformers for long-context language modeling, particularly in applications requiring extensive in-context retrieval or handling complex long-range dependencies, while maintaining constant memory usage.  The paper doesn't explicitly detail how the gating network's selection criteria impacts the overall computational efficiency, leaving some ambiguity on the balance achieved.    Follow-Up Questions:  1. What are the specific criteria used by the gating network to select tokens for attention processing, and how can these criteria be tuned or adapted for different downstream tasks?  2. What is the computational complexity of the gating network itself, and how does it scale with increasing sequence length and model size?  3. Could the selective attention mechanism be adapted for other efficient architectures beyond Mamba-2, such as S4 or other SSM variants?  |
| Value Residual Learning For Alleviating Attention Concentration In Transformers (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17897) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.17897))| Zhenzhong Lan, Zhiyun Jiang, Tianyi Wu, Zcchill | This research addresses the problem of attention concentration in deep transformers, where attention increasingly focuses on fewer tokens with depth.  The authors propose ResFormer, which adds a residual connection from the first layer's value embeddings to subsequent layers before the attention operation.  Results on a 20B SlimPajama dataset show ResFormer achieves lower training loss than vanilla Transformers, DenseFormer, and NeuTRENO, with a 3% average accuracy improvement on downstream zero-shot reasoning tasks for an 82M parameter model.  A variant, SVFormer, shares the first layer's value embeddings across all layers, reducing KV cache by nearly half and demonstrating competitive performance on longer sequence lengths.  The primary implication for AI practitioners is that ResFormer and SVFormer offer ways to improve training and inference efficiency of deep transformers.  Follow-up Questions:  1. How does the performance of ResFormer and SVFormer vary across different downstream tasks beyond commonsense reasoning, and in different modalities like vision? 2. What are the memory and speed trade-offs of using SVFormer compared to other KV-efficient methods like GQA and CLA in real-world deployment scenarios? 3. Could the "anchor" approach of updating shared values in SVFormer using intermediate layers be further optimized, and how would this impact performance and stability on extremely long sequences?  |
| Multi-Draft Speculative Sampling: Canonical Architectures and Theoretical Limits (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18234) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18234))| Roland Memisevic, Arash Behboodi, Hassan Dbouk, Ashish Khisti, mamaj92 | a) This research investigates multi-draft speculative sampling for accelerating large language model (LLM) inference, aiming to maximize the probability of accepting proposed tokens from multiple draft models. b) The authors analyze the optimal token-level draft selection problem, proposing a two-step canonical architecture involving importance sampling followed by single-draft speculative sampling, and derive an analytical expression for the optimal acceptance probability with two identical drafts. c) Experiments using the OPT model on Dolly, XSum, and WMT datasets demonstrate that their importance sampling scheme consistently outperforms baseline multi-draft speculative sampling methods, achieving, for example, over 2.1 block efficiency in the Dolly task with two drafts at a temperature of 1.2. d) The paper suggests that using importance sampling followed by speculative sampling offers improved block efficiency and token rates for LLM inference compared to existing multi-draft methods.  It remains unclear how the proposed successive selection scheme scales with the number of drafts (K > 2) beyond the brief description in Remark 4.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does the computational overhead of the importance sampling step compare to the gains in block efficiency, especially for different draft model sizes and numbers of drafts? 2.  Could the theoretical analysis for two drafts be extended or approximated for a greater number of drafts (K>2) to guide the design of more efficient selection schemes? 3.  How robust is the proposed method to variations in draft model quality, and what strategies could be employed to mitigate performance degradation with less accurate draft models?  |

| MIA-DPO: Multi-Image Augmented Direct Preference Optimization For Large Vision-Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17637) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.17637))| conghui, KennyUTC, yhcao, yuhangzang, ziyuliu | a) The research aims to improve the ability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to understand and reason with multi-image inputs, addressing the issue of hallucinations in these scenarios.  b) The authors introduce Multi-Image Augmented Direct Preference Optimization (MIA-DPO), which extends single-image datasets to multi-image contexts by incorporating unrelated images and uses attention values to select rejected responses for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training.  c) MIA-DPO improved performance on five multi-image benchmarks, achieving an average boost of 3.0% on LLaVA-v1.5 and 4.3% on InternLM-XC2.5.  d) MIA-DPO offers a cost-effective and scalable approach for aligning LVLMs with human preferences in multi-image contexts, without relying on manual annotations or expensive APIs.  This allows AI practitioners to enhance the multi-image reasoning capabilities of LVLMs using existing single-image data.   Follow-up Questions:  1. How does the performance of MIA-DPO vary across different LVLM architectures beyond LLaVA and InternLM, and what modifications might be needed for optimal application to other models?  2.  What are the computational resource requirements of MIA-DPO compared to other preference optimization methods, particularly regarding the attention-based selection process?  3. Could the attention-aware selection mechanism be further refined by incorporating other metrics or heuristics to enhance its effectiveness in identifying and filtering hallucinatory responses?  |
| WorldSimBench: Towards Video Generation Models as World Simulators (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18072) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18072))| XihuiLiu, JeremyYin, LIJUNLI, Zhoues, CoachXP | This research aims to evaluate video generation models as "World Simulators," capable of generating actionable, embodied video. The authors propose WorldSimBench, a dual evaluation framework comprising Explicit Perceptual Evaluation (using a Human Preference Evaluator trained on a novel HF-Embodied dataset with human feedback) and Implicit Manipulative Evaluation (assessing video-action consistency in simulated environments).  Results show the Human Preference Evaluator surpasses GPT-40 in alignment with human preferences, achieving 89.4% accuracy in Open-Ended Embodied Environments. This implies that using human feedback to train evaluators is more effective for assessing video quality in embodied scenarios than zero-shot GPT-40 evaluations. The key takeaway for AI practitioners is that while current video generation models show some promise in generating realistic and controllable video, they still struggle to consistently represent complex physical rules and embody actions, hindering their practical use as World Simulators.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does the architecture of the Human Preference Evaluator compare to other video quality assessment models, and what are the trade-offs of using a fine-tuned VideoLLM approach? 2.  Could the HF-Embodied dataset, with its fine-grained human feedback, be used to improve video generation models themselves, in addition to training evaluators? 3. What are the specific limitations of the chosen simulation environments (Minecraft, CARLA, CALVIN) and how might these limitations affect the generalizability of the benchmark results to real-world applications?  |
| Scaling Diffusion Language Models via Adaptation from Autoregressive Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17891) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.17891))| Jiacheng Ye, Yizhe Zhang, kiaia, shivamag99, Sansa | This research explores scaling diffusion language models (DLMs) by adapting pre-trained autoregressive language models (AR LMs).  The authors introduce a continual pre-training approach involving attention mask annealing and a shift operation to bridge the gap between AR and diffusion modeling objectives.  Their adapted DLMs, DiffuGPT and DiffuLLaMA (scaled up to 7B parameters), outperform prior DLMs on language modeling, reasoning, and infilling tasks, with DiffuGPT-S achieving 50.2% accuracy on GSM8K after fine-tuning.  This implies that adapting existing AR LMs is a viable method for developing competitive DLMs. AI practitioners can utilize this adaptation method to build more efficient and effective DLMs for various tasks, particularly those requiring infilling and global reasoning, without extensive training from scratch.   Follow-up questions:  1.  What are the computational resource requirements and training times for adapting larger AR LMs (e.g., >10B parameters) into DLMs using this method? 2.  How does the choice of pre-training corpus (e.g., FineWeb vs. SlimPajama) affect the performance of the adapted DLMs on specific downstream tasks? 3.  Could incorporating other techniques from AR LMs, like reinforcement learning with human feedback, further enhance the performance of adapted DLMs, especially for tasks like instruction following and code generation?  |
| Lightweight Neural App Control (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17883) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.17883))| Jianye Hao, ShaoKun-HW, Fahren24, gpap, semitable | This research aims to develop a lightweight, efficient mobile phone control architecture for cross-app interaction.  The proposed LiMAC architecture combines a small Action Transformer (AcT) with a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM), processing screenshots, UI trees, and text instructions to generate actions.  LiMAC achieved up to 19% higher action accuracy compared to fine-tuned VLMs and up to 42% higher accuracy than prompt engineering baselines on two mobile control datasets. This implies AI practitioners can develop more accurate and resource-efficient mobile app agents using a gated architecture approach rather than relying solely on large foundation models. The paper is unclear on the exact size (parameter count) of AcT.  Follow-up questions:  1.  What are the specific implementation details and computational requirements of deploying the AcT + VLM architecture on resource-constrained mobile devices? 2.  How does the performance of LiMAC compare with other lightweight models or techniques specifically designed for on-device inference, beyond those mentioned in the paper? 3.  Could the contrastive learning approach used for click target prediction be extended or generalized to other types of action specifications beyond UI element selection?  |
| Scalable Ranked Preference Optimization for Text-to-Image Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18013) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18013))| Sergey Tulyakov, Zeynep Akata, anilkagak2, hcoskun, shyamgopal | This research aims to develop a scalable and cost-effective method for aligning text-to-image (T2I) models with human preferences. The authors introduce a synthetically labeled preference dataset (Syn-Pic) created by ranking images generated from multiple T2I models using pre-trained reward models and a ranking-based preference optimization method (RankDPO) leveraging this dataset.  Results on DPG-Bench show RankDPO improves the DSG score for SDXL from 74.65 to 79.26. This implies AI practitioners can efficiently fine-tune T2I models for improved prompt following and visual quality without expensive human annotation.  The paper doesn't explicitly compare the computational cost of RankDPO with other DPO methods, only with reward optimization methods.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does the diversity of the T2I models used to generate Syn-Pic impact the performance of RankDPO on downstream tasks, and what is the optimal number or combination of models? 2. How robust is RankDPO to the choice of pre-trained reward models used for creating Syn-Pic, and does using a larger ensemble of reward models always lead to better performance? 3. How does the performance of RankDPO, in terms of both effectiveness and computational cost, compare to other DPO variants applied to text-to-image generation, when using the same evaluation metrics and datasets?  |
| DynamicCity: Large-Scale LiDAR Generation from Dynamic Scenes (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18084) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18084))| Yu Qiao, Liang Pan, Haozhe Xie, Lingdong Kong, Hengwei Bian | a) The research aims to develop a framework for generating large-scale, dynamic 4D LiDAR scenes capturing the temporal evolution of environments.  b) DynamicCity uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn a compact 4D representation called HexPlane, and a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to generate novel HexPlanes, which are then decoded into 4D LiDAR scenes. A novel Projection Module and Expansion & Squeeze Strategy are introduced for enhanced VAE performance, and a Padded Rollout Operation prepares HexPlane features for DiT training.  c) DynamicCity outperforms existing methods on CarlaSC and Waymo datasets in 4D scene reconstruction and generation tasks. For example, on CarlaSC, DynamicCity achieved a 38.6% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) for 4D scene reconstruction compared to OccSora when using 16 frames as input.  d) AI practitioners, specifically those working in autonomous driving and robotics, can leverage DynamicCity to generate synthetic 4D LiDAR data for training and testing perception systems, supplementing or replacing expensive and time-consuming real-world data collection. The ability to generate diverse and dynamic scenes, including rare edge cases, can lead to the development of more robust and safe autonomous systems.  Follow-up questions:  1. What are the computational requirements for training and deploying DynamicCity, and how scalable is it to even larger datasets and longer sequence lengths?  2. The paper mentions known limitations related to highly congested scenes.  Could you elaborate on the specific challenges encountered and potential strategies for mitigating these issues in future work?  3. What is the impact of different choices for the diffusion scheduler on the quality and diversity of the generated 4D LiDAR scenes?  |
| ARKit LabelMaker: A New Scale for Indoor 3D Scene Understanding (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13924) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.13924))| Hermann Blum, Marc Pollefeys, Francis Engelmann, Silvan Weder, Guangda Ji | This research investigates whether large-scale pre-training with automatically generated labels benefits 3D semantic segmentation similar to language and image generation tasks.  The authors generated ARKit LabelMaker, a large-scale, real-world 3D dataset with dense semantic annotations by supplementing the ARKitScenes dataset with automatically generated labels using an enhanced LabelMaker pipeline.  Pre-training PointTransformerV3 on this dataset achieved 81.2% mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) on the ScanNet validation set, exceeding vanilla training (77.5% mIoU) and comparable to multi-dataset joint training. This indicates the value of large-scale, real-world data for 3D semantic segmentation, even with imperfect labels.  AI practitioners can leverage this dataset and the improved LabelMakerV2 pipeline for pre-training and potentially improve performance on downstream 3D scene understanding tasks.  Follow-up questions:  1.  How does the performance of models pre-trained on ARKit LabelMaker compare to those pre-trained on synthetic datasets of similar or larger scale, specifically regarding generalization to diverse real-world scenarios? 2.  The paper mentions limitations due to computational cost for certain parts of LabelMaker and missing pose data in some ARKitScenes. How significantly do these limitations impact the overall quality and usability of the generated dataset for pre-training?  3.  What are the specific details of the enhancements made to the LabelMaker pipeline in LabelMakerV2, and how do these improvements contribute to the scalability and robustness of the automatic labeling process?  |
| MedINST: Meta Dataset of Biomedical Instructions (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13458) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.13458))| Zirui Song, Yu Yin, Zihan Zhang, Meng Fang, Wenhan Han | a) This research aimed to address the challenge of limited biomedical instruction datasets for training large language models (LLMs) by creating a comprehensive resource and benchmark.  b) The researchers created MEDINST, a meta-dataset of 133 biomedical natural language processing (NLP) tasks and over 7 million training samples, and MEDINST32, a benchmark subset of 32 tasks with varying difficulty levels, to evaluate LLM generalization.  Several LLMs, including LLaMA-3 variants, were fine-tuned on MEDINST and evaluated on MEDINST32.  c)  LLaMA-3 fine-tuned on MEDINST (LLaMA3-MI) outperformed GPT-40 on 25 out of 32 tasks in MEDINST32.  d) This suggests that using a comprehensive instruction dataset like MEDINST for fine-tuning significantly improves the performance of LLMs on biomedical tasks, even surpassing specialized models like BioMistral, offering practitioners a powerful resource for developing robust biomedical LLMs.  Follow-up questions:  1.  What specific prompting strategies were used during the few-shot evaluation of baseline models and zero-shot evaluation of fine-tuned models, and how did these choices affect performance?  2.  Given the observed performance degradation in summarization and event extraction with increased training data size, attributed to data imbalance, what data augmentation or balancing techniques could be explored to mitigate this issue and improve performance on these tasks?  3.  Could the authors provide further details on the annotation process for the human-annotated instructions, including inter-annotator agreement and quality control measures, to ensure the consistency and reliability of the MEDINST dataset?  |
| M-RewardBench: Evaluating Reward Models in Multilingual Settings (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15522) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.15522))| Drishti Sharma, Rishabh Maheshwary, Lester James V. Miranda, shayekh, srishti-hf1110 | This research investigates the performance of reward models (RMs) in multilingual settings.  The authors created M-REWARDBENCH, a multilingual dataset with 2.87k preference instances across 23 languages and tasks including chat, safety, reasoning, and translation. Evaluation of 25 RMs on M-REWARDBENCH revealed a performance gap between English and non-English languages, with an average drop of over 8% for Classifier and Implicit RMs compared to their performance on the English-centric RewardBench. Generative RMs exhibited the smallest average performance drop at 3%. This implies that AI practitioners should prioritize evaluating and potentially adapting RMs for diverse languages to ensure consistent performance across global user bases.  Follow-up questions:  1.  How does the performance gap observed in M-REWARDBENCH translate to downstream performance of policy models fine-tuned with these RMs in different languages? 2.  The paper mentions filtering English-centric prompts. What specific criteria were used for this filtering, and how might these criteria be adapted for other languages beyond those in M-REWARDBENCH? 3.  Beyond the linguistic dimensions explored, what other cultural factors might influence RM preferences, and how can these be incorporated into future multilingual benchmark development?  |
| TP-Eval: Tap Multimodal LLMs' Potential in Evaluation by Customizing Prompts (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18071) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18071))| Tianhua Li, Yuxuan Xie, kpzhang, wqshao126 | a) This paper investigates the problem of prompt sensitivity in Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) evaluation, where minor prompt variations can lead to significant performance fluctuations, and proposes a new evaluation framework to mitigate this.  b) The proposed framework, TP-Eval, uses an automatic prompt customization method employing an optimizer-scorer architecture with GPT-40 mini as an optimizer and the evaluated MLLM as a scorer, iteratively generating and evaluating prompts based on accuracy and semantic similarity to the original prompt.  Error introspection from incorrect responses is also incorporated into the optimization process.  c)  On the MMT-S benchmark (a subset of MMT-Bench), LLaVA-1.5-7B achieved a 25.1% average performance improvement across 32 tasks after prompt customization using TP-Eval.  d) AI practitioners evaluating MLLMs should consider prompt customization techniques like TP-Eval to mitigate underestimation caused by prompt sensitivity and obtain a more accurate assessment of model capabilities. The impactful finding is the significant performance improvement achieved by tailoring prompts to individual MLLMs, suggesting current evaluation methods may not fully reveal models' potential.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does TP-Eval's performance compare to other prompt engineering techniques, specifically those designed for few-shot scenarios in multimodal settings? 2. How does the computational cost of running TP-Eval's prompt optimization process scale with the size of the evaluation dataset and the complexity of the MLLM? 3. What are the limitations of relying on GPT-40 mini as the optimizer, and how could these limitations affect the optimization results for different MLLMs?  |

It also allows training with doubled input resolution at 70% of the original training cost.  d)  AI practitioners can use PyramidDrop to accelerate both training and inference of LVLMs, particularly for high-resolution image understanding, without substantial performance degradation. The plug-and-play nature of PyramidDrop for inference acceleration is particularly advantageous for deployment on resource-constrained devices.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does the performance of PyramidDrop compare to other token reduction methods, such as those focusing on text token reduction, when applied in conjunction?  2.

The improved handling of dynamic specular reflections enables more realistic and accurate 3D models, which can enhance various AI applications.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the computational cost of SpectroMotion compare to other dynamic 3DGS methods, particularly during the training and rendering phases?  2. What are the limitations of the deformable environment map, and how might it be further improved to handle more complex lighting variations in dynamic scenes? 3.

| Aligning Large Language Models via Self-Steering Optimization (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17131) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.17131))| Jingren, xphan, luyaojie, keminglu, sanmusunrise | a) This research aims to develop an automated alignment method for Large Language Models (LLMs) that eliminates the need for manual preference annotation.  b) The proposed method, Self-Steering Optimization (SSO), autonomously generates preference signals during iterative training based on predefined principles, maintaining signal accuracy by ensuring a consistent quality gap between chosen and rejected responses while keeping them near on-policy.  c)  SSO improved the AlpacaEval 2.0 length control win rate by approximately 8% on average for the Llama3.1-8B-SFT model compared to the base model over three training iterations.  d) SSO offers a scalable approach for LLM alignment, reducing the reliance on expensive and potentially limiting human annotation, which could enable more efficient and effective development of aligned LLMs.  e) The paper mentions using a weight function and self-steering loss but does not fully explain their specific mathematical formulations or how the principles are predefined.   Follow-up questions:  1.  What is the specific mathematical formulation of the weight function (W) and self-steering loss (G) used in SSO? How are these components integrated into the overall training objective?  2. How are the "predefined principles" selected or generated, and what is the complete set of principles used in the experiments? How can these principles be adapted or extended for different alignment tasks or domains?  3. Could the authors elaborate on the computational overhead introduced by SSO compared to standard alignment techniques like RLHF or DPO?  |
| JMMMU: A Japanese Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding Benchmark for Culture-aware Evaluation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17250) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.17250))| Yuki Imajuku, gneubig, ku21fan, AtsuMiyai, shtapm | This research aims to evaluate Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on expert-level tasks in Japanese, focusing on both culture-agnostic and culture-specific understanding.  The authors developed JMMMU, a benchmark dataset comprising 1,320 questions and 1,118 images across 28 subjects, including translated culture-agnostic components from MMMU and newly created culture-specific content.  Evaluation of 18 LMMs revealed a performance ceiling of 58.6% accuracy achieved by GPT-4, indicating substantial room for improvement.  GPT-4 outperformed Claude 3.5 Sonnet by 15.7% on culture-specific tasks, despite similar performance on English benchmarks and translated Japanese questions, highlighting the importance of culturally contextualized evaluation.  This discrepancy has significant implications for practitioners developing multilingual LMMs, indicating that relying solely on translated benchmarks could overestimate true multilingual capability and lead to biased development.  Follow-up questions:  1.  Could the authors provide further details on the specific types of questions and images within the culture-specific subset of JMMMU to guide targeted model improvements? 2.  What are the specific metrics used to determine "expert-level" difficulty, and how were these levels calibrated within the JMMMU dataset? 3.  The paper mentions Japanese LMMs exhibit robustness to translation effects; could the authors elaborate on the specific training datasets and techniques that contribute to this robustness?  |
| EvoPress: Towards Optimal Dynamic Model Compression via Evolutionary Search (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14649) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.14649))| dalistarh, ekurtic, SpiridonSunRotator, OliverSieberling | This paper investigates optimal dynamic compression of Large Language Models (LLMs) to minimize accuracy loss under a global compression constraint.  The researchers developed EvoPress, an evolutionary search algorithm with level-switch mutation and multi-step selection, which has provable convergence and low sample complexity.  EvoPress achieved state-of-the-art results across structural pruning, unstructured sparsity, and quantization with dynamic bitwidths; for example, it improved zero-shot average accuracy by 4.1 points on Llama-3-8B at 70% unstructured sparsity. This implies that AI practitioners can use EvoPress to significantly improve the accuracy-compression trade-off in compressed LLMs. The paper does not provide detailed information on the computational resources (e.g., GPU memory) required to run EvoPress on the tested models.  Follow-up questions:  1.  Could EvoPress be effectively applied to dynamic compression during the *training* of LLMs, and if so, how would the search process be integrated with the training loop? 2. What is the memory footprint of EvoPress when running on larger LLMs (e.g., 70B parameter models) for different compression tasks, and how could this be optimized? 3. How does the choice of calibration dataset affect the final compressed model quality obtained by EvoPress, and are there guidelines for selecting a suitable calibration dataset for a given task or domain?  |
| MiniPLM: Knowledge Distillation for Pre-Training Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17215) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.17215))| Minlie Huang, Jie Zhou, Hao Zhou, fandong, t1101675 | a) The research aimed to develop an efficient and flexible knowledge distillation (KD) framework for pre-training language models (LMs) that addresses the limitations of existing online and offline KD methods.  b) MINIPLM utilizes *Difference Sampling*, an offline method that refines the pre-training corpus based on the probability discrepancies between a large teacher LM and a small reference LM.  The student LM is then pre-trained from scratch on this refined corpus.  c) MINIPLM improved the zero-shot performance of a 500M parameter student LM by 2.2x compared to vanilla KD while using the same training compute budget, as measured by average zero-shot accuracy across nine downstream tasks.  d) AI practitioners can use MINIPLM to train smaller, more efficient student LMs that achieve competitive performance with larger models while reducing computational costs and potentially data requirements. The framework's flexibility also facilitates KD across different model families.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the performance of MINIPLM vary with different sizes of reference LMs, and how can we optimally choose the reference LM size for a given teacher-student pair?  2.  The paper mentions reducing data requirements in a data-limited setting.  Can this be quantified more precisely with different dataset sizes, and what are the tradeoffs between dataset size and performance when using MINIPLM?  3. How does MINIPLM compare to other recent KD methods for pre-training, especially those focusing on data selection or curriculum learning, in terms of both performance and efficiency?  |
| Mitigating Object Hallucination via Concentric Causal Attention (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15926) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.15926))| Shijian Lu, Ivan Laptev, Yiheng Li, xing0047 | a) The paper investigates the correlation between Rotary Position Encoding (ROPE) and object hallucination in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), aiming to mitigate this hallucination.  b)  The authors propose Concentric Causal Attention (CCA), a positional alignment strategy involving visual token reorganization and a modified causal attention mask, to address ROPE's long-term decay issue.  c) On the POPE benchmark, CCA achieves an accuracy improvement of 5.48% on the COCO dataset with random negative sampling, compared to the baseline LLaVA model.  d)  AI practitioners working with LVLMs can use CCA during training to reduce object hallucination by improving visual-instructional token interaction and mitigating the negative effects of ROPE's long-term decay.  This translates to more factually accurate responses from LVLMs.    Follow-up questions:  1.  How does CCA's computational cost during training and inference compare to the baseline LLaVA and other hallucination mitigation strategies like VCD? 2.  The paper mentions CCA’s potential for broader improvements to LVLM perception. Can the authors elaborate on the types and magnitudes of improvements observed on other perception tasks beyond object hallucination? 3.

Christ | a) This research investigates how mathematical reasoning abilities are encoded within Large Language Models (LLMs) and whether math-specific parameters can be isolated.  b) The researchers developed MathNeuro, a method utilizing forward passes and weight-activation products to identify parameters important for math reasoning, while excluding those important for general language tasks (tested using RACE and MMLU datasets).  c) Pruning MathNeuro-identified parameters eliminates math performance (measured on GSM8K), while scaling these parameters by a small factor improves GSM8K performance by 4-17% across various model sizes (1B-8B parameters) without significantly affecting non-math performance.  d) AI practitioners can use MathNeuro to target and modify specific LLM parameters to improve mathematical reasoning abilities without negatively impacting performance on other tasks.  The demonstrated ability to boost math reasoning by 4-17% through a simple scaling intervention is impactful, offering a concrete method for enhancing LLM capabilities for math-intensive applications.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does the computational cost of MathNeuro scale with increasing LLM size, and what are the practical implications for applying this method to very large models? 2. Can MathNeuro be adapted to isolate and enhance other specific reasoning abilities beyond mathematics, such as logical reasoning or causal inference? 3. How robust is the parameter identification in MathNeuro to the choice of non-math datasets used for comparison, and are there alternative datasets or tasks that might provide more effective isolation?  |

| Meta-Chunking: Learning Efficient Text Segmentation via Logical Perception (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12788) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.12788))| Zhiyuan Ji, jimi888, siminniu, MoCun, Robot2050 | This paper investigates how to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of text chunking in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines.  The authors propose "Meta-Chunking," which leverages LLMs with two strategies: Margin Sampling Chunking (binary classification of segmentation points based on probability differences) and Perplexity Chunking (identifying chunk boundaries based on perplexity distribution minima).  Results on eleven datasets, including 2WikiMultihopQA, demonstrate that Meta-Chunking with Qwen2-1.5B outperforms similarity chunking by 1.32 F1 points while using only 45.8% of the processing time.  This suggests that Meta-Chunking, especially Perplexity Chunking, offers a more efficient and potentially more accurate method for text segmentation in RAG, allowing practitioners to optimize resource allocation and potentially improve the quality of downstream tasks like question answering.  Follow-up questions:  1.  How does the performance of Meta-Chunking compare to LumberChunker on additional datasets beyond those mentioned in the paper, especially focusing on resource consumption and processing time differences? 2.  Could the dynamic merging strategy of Meta-Chunking be further refined by incorporating semantic similarity metrics or other logical relationship classifiers to optimize chunk coherence beyond length constraints? 3.  What are the practical limitations or challenges of implementing Meta-Chunking in a real-world RAG system, specifically concerning the computational overhead of integrating LLMs for chunking and potential failure modes in diverse textual contexts?  |
| Pre-training Distillation for Large Language Models: A Design Space Exploration (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16215) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.16215))| Xin Lv, juanli, NeoZ123, bys0318, Wesleythu | a) This paper explores the design space of pre-training distillation (PD) for Large Language Models (LLMs), investigating whether distilling knowledge during the pre-training phase is feasible and how to optimize it.  b) The researchers systematically explored four dimensions of PD: logits processing (truncation, normalization), loss selection (KL divergence, MSE, NLL), scaling laws (model and corpus size), and offline vs. online logits generation.  They conducted controlled experiments using GLM-4-9B as the teacher model and various smaller student LLMs.  c)  Pre-training distillation with a WSD scheduler for both the combination factor of language modeling and distillation loss (α), and learning rate (WSD-α + WSD-LR) resulted in an average performance improvement of 8.0% across multiple datasets compared to a baseline LLM trained only with language modeling loss.  d) AI practitioners can leverage pre-training distillation, particularly with a WSD scheduling strategy, to improve the performance of student LLMs trained from scratch, potentially reducing training time and resources.  e) The paper lacks clear explanation regarding the hardware used in the SFT stage and the specific datasets used for fine-tuning.  The selection rationale for the chosen dataset sizes in the preliminary and scaling law experiments is not explicitly provided.  Follow-up questions:  1. What are the computational cost savings of using pre-training distillation compared to training a student LLM from scratch without distillation, considering the overhead of logits generation and storage?  2.  Could the authors elaborate on the hardware and data used in the Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) stage, and how these choices might affect the generalizability of the results?  3.  How does the performance of pre-training distillation change with varying dataset sizes, particularly exceeding the explored range, and how could practitioners determine the optimal dataset size for a given LLM size and available resources?   |
| Alchemy: Amplifying Theorem-Proving Capability through Symbolic Mutation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15748) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.15748))| Ping Wei, opotle, yegong, shuailu, EurekaWu123 | This research aims to improve Neural Theorem Proving (NTP) by addressing data scarcity. The authors propose "Alchemy," a framework that synthesizes new theorems in the Lean formal system by symbolically mutating existing theorems in Mathlib4 using the *rw* and *apply* tactics.  This method increased the number of theorems by an order of magnitude, from 110,657 to 6,326,679. After pretraining and finetuning LLMs on this augmented data, a 5% absolute performance improvement was observed on the Leandojo novel_premises benchmark. This implies that synthetic data generation can enhance the theorem-proving ability and generalization of LLMs, offering a valuable resource for developers of automated theorem provers.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does the performance of the theorem prover vary with different filtering strategies applied to the set of invocable theorems *Tᵢ*?  Could more sophisticated filtering based on theorem complexity or relevance further improve data quality and downstream performance? 2.  The paper mentions the computational cost of the synthesis process.  What specific optimizations to Leandojo or the synthesis algorithm itself could be implemented to make this approach more scalable and efficient for larger datasets or more complex tactic combinations? 3. Could the proposed symbolic mutation approach be generalized to other formal systems besides Lean, and what adaptations would be necessary to accommodate different syntax and proof structures?  |
| SemiEvol: Semi-supervised Fine-tuning for LLM Adaptation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14745) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.14745))| Wei Ju, Xiao Luo, Shockzipper, XtremSup, luojunyu | This research investigates how to adapt LLMs to specific domains using both labeled and unlabeled data. The authors introduce SemiEvol, a framework that propagates knowledge from labeled to unlabeled data using in-weight and in-context methods, and then selects high-quality pseudo-labeled data through collaborative learning and adaptive selection for further fine-tuning.  Experiments on seven datasets show SemiEvol improves Llama3.1-8B performance on MMLU from 67.9% (SFT baseline) to 70.3%.  This implies that AI practitioners can significantly enhance LLM performance and adaptability in target scenarios by leveraging unlabeled data alongside limited labeled datasets. The paper doesn't specify the hardware used for training or inference.  Follow-up questions:  1.  What is the computational cost of the collaborative learning stage, and how does it scale with the number of collaborating LLMs (n)? 2.  How does the choice of embedding function ε(.) for in-context propagation affect overall performance on different downstream tasks? 3.  Could the adaptive selection strategy be further improved by incorporating other metrics beyond entropy, such as model confidence scores or agreement among the collaborating LLMs?  |
| Zero-shot Model-based Reinforcement Learning using Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11711) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.11711))| GPaolo, albert9000, Xssama, ambroiseodt, abenechehab | This paper investigates how pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used for zero-shot dynamics prediction in continuous-state Markov Decision Processes.  The researchers developed Disentangled In-Context Learning (DICL), which uses Principal Component Analysis to address the challenges of incorporating action information and state dimension interdependence in LLM contexts.  In the HalfCheetah environment, DICL reduced multi-step prediction error compared to a vanilla ICL approach and an MLP baseline.  Specifically, using half the number of original features, DICL achieved lower multi-step prediction errors and significantly decreased computational time compared to vanilla ICL.  This suggests LLMs, combined with DICL, can improve sample efficiency and accelerate learning in model-based reinforcement learning by accurately predicting dynamics from limited trajectories.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does the choice of dimensionality reduction technique (PCA in this case) affect the performance and calibration of DICL in various environments, and are there alternative techniques that might be better suited for specific MDP characteristics? 2.  What are the scaling properties of DICL with increasing state and action space dimensionality, and how can the computational cost of LLM inference be further optimized for real-time applications? 3. The paper mentions the potential for using autoencoders within DICL. Have experiments been conducted in this direction, and if so, how does the performance compare to the PCA-based approach, especially regarding the disentanglement capabilities?  |
| Selecting Influential Samples for Long Context Alignment via Homologous Models' Guidance and Contextual Awareness Measurement (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15633) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.15633))| Yunshui Li, Gang Chen, Haozhe Zhao, Shuzheng Si, kaikai1 | a) This research addresses the challenge of selecting high-quality training samples from synthetic long instruction-following data for improved long context alignment in LLMs.  b) The proposed GATEAU framework ranks samples based on combined scores from Homologous Models' Guidance (HMG), which measures difficulty of response generation due to long-range dependencies, and Contextual Awareness Measurement (CAM), which evaluates the model's focus on important segments in long input contexts.  c)  Using only 30% of the LongAlign dataset selected by GATEAU, the fine-tuned LLaMA model achieved a 9% improvement on the LongBench-Chat benchmark compared to training on the entire dataset.  d) AI practitioners can use GATEAU to improve the data efficiency and performance of LLMs on long-context tasks by selecting influential training samples enriched with long-range dependencies.  The impactful finding of a significant performance boost with a smaller, curated dataset has direct relevance for efficient LLM fine-tuning.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the computational cost of GATEAU's sample selection process compare to the cost of training on the full dataset, and at what scale (dataset size, model size) does GATEAU become more cost-effective?  2.  How robust is GATEAU to the choice of homologous models, particularly when applied to different LLM architectures or different pre-training datasets?  3.  Could GATEAU be adapted for few-shot or zero-shot settings where fine-tuning isn't possible, and if so, how would the selection criteria be modified?  |
| CBT-Bench: Evaluating Large Language Models on Assisting Cognitive Behavior Therapy (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13218) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.13218))| Travis Labrum, wangwilliamyang, xz97, Xianjun, billmianz | This research investigates the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in assisting Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).  The authors developed CBT-BENCH, a three-level benchmark comprising multiple-choice questions, cognitive model understanding tasks (cognitive distortion, primary/fine-grained core belief classification), and therapeutic response generation tasks based on Deliberate Practice exercises.  Experimental results showed that while larger LLMs performed better on basic CBT knowledge questions (e.g., Gemma-2-9B achieved 90% accuracy), their performance on fine-grained core belief classification remained poor (weighted F1 score of 54.6% for the best-performing model). This indicates a limitation in current LLMs' ability to understand complex cognitive models, even with increasing size.  AI practitioners should focus on improving LLMs' capacity for deep cognitive model analysis beyond simple knowledge recall to enhance their potential for assisting in real-world CBT applications.  Follow-up questions:  1.  What specific architectural modifications or training strategies might be explored to improve LLMs' performance on fine-grained belief classification and cognitive model understanding, given that simply increasing model size doesn't seem sufficient?  2.  How could the Deliberate Practice exercises for therapeutic response generation be adapted or expanded to better assess empathetic and autonomy-respecting responses, given that the current evaluation criteria might not fully capture these nuanced aspects of CBT?  3.  What are the ethical implications of using LLMs to analyze patient speech and assist in therapy, and what safeguards should be implemented to ensure patient privacy and responsible use of this technology?  |
| Cross-Lingual Auto Evaluation for Assessing Multilingual LLMs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13394) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.13394))| anoopk, prajdabre, dipsivenkatesh, safikhan, sumanthd | a) This research aimed to develop a framework for automated, cross-lingual evaluation of multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs).  b) The researchers created a novel multilingual test set (RECON) and trained a series of evaluator LLMs (HERCULE) on an automatically translated training set (INTEL) derived from an English evaluation dataset.  HERCULE uses reference answers in English to assess responses generated in other languages. c) On the RECON test set, the fine-tuned HERCULE model achieved a linear weighted Cohen's Kappa (κ) score of 0.73, outperforming zero-shot evaluations with large, proprietary LLMs like GPT-4. d) This work provides AI practitioners with a scalable and more effective approach for evaluating multilingual LLMs, especially in low-resource scenarios, by leveraging readily available English references.  The superior performance of the trained evaluator highlights the benefit of training specialized models for evaluation tasks.  Follow-up questions: 1.  How does the performance of HERCULE vary across different language families or typologically distinct languages? 2.  Given the observation of HERCULE sometimes relying on parametric knowledge instead of the reference answer, what strategies could be employed to improve its reliance on the provided references? 3.  What are the limitations of relying on automatically translated training data like INTEL, and how can these limitations be addressed in future research?  |
| DM-Codec: Distilling Multimodal Representations for Speech Tokenization (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15017) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.15017))| A K M Mahbubur Rahman, Md Fahim, amanchadha, tasnim, mubtasim | a) The research aims to improve speech tokenization by incorporating contextual information from language models (LMs) and semantic information from self-supervised speech models (SMs) alongside acoustic information.  b) The proposed DM-Codec utilizes a neural codec architecture with Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) and introduces novel LM-guided and combined LM and SM-guided distillation techniques to integrate multimodal representations into the learning process.  c) DM-Codec achieved a Word Error Rate (WER) of 4.05 and a Word Information Lost (WIL) of 6.61 on the LibriSpeech benchmark, outperforming baseline models like SpeechTokenizer, FACodec, and EnCodec.  d) AI practitioners can leverage DM-Codec's distillation approach to build more contextually and semantically aware speech tokenizers, leading to improved performance in downstream speech-related tasks such as speech synthesis and speech-to-text.  The significant reduction in WER and WIL directly translates to more accurate and information-rich speech transcription and generation.  Follow-up Questions:  1. How does the computational cost of DM-Codec during inference compare to the baseline models, given the added complexity of multimodal distillation during training?  2.  The paper mentions using a specific set of pre-trained LMs and SMs.  What is the impact of using different pre-trained models (e.g., larger LMs or more recent SM architectures) on the performance of DM-Codec?  3. How does DM-Codec perform on noisy or accented speech data compared to the baseline models, and what modifications could be made to improve its robustness in such scenarios?  |

| Web Agents with World Models: Learning and Leveraging Environment Dynamics in Web Navigation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13232) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.13232))| jihoonkim25, Gwanwoo, ktio, kimnamssya, hyungjoochae | a) This research investigates the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in web navigation, particularly their lack of “world models” (awareness of action outcomes), and proposes World-Model-Augmented (WMA) web agents to address this. b) WMA agents use a world model trained on a dataset with transition-focused observation abstraction (highlighting state differences between time steps) to predict action outcomes, and a value function to select the action leading to the highest estimated reward. c)  WMA agents achieve a 43.6% improvement in success rate over vanilla Chain-of-Thought prompting in the Map domain of the WebArena benchmark using GPT-40-mini as the policy model. d) AI practitioners can leverage WMA agents to improve the decision-making of LLM-based web agents by incorporating the ability to simulate action consequences without training the policy model, leading to more efficient and goal-directed web navigation. This suggests world models are a promising direction for improving agent performance in complex, long-horizon web navigation tasks.  Follow-up questions:  1.  How does the performance of the WMA agent vary across different LLM architectures and sizes used for both the world model and the policy model? 2.

| UCFE: A User-Centric Financial Expertise Benchmark for Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14059) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.14059))| SP4595, Yueru1, wittenberg, amstrongzyf, TobyYang7 | This paper introduces UCFE, a benchmark designed to evaluate large language models' (LLMs) ability to handle complex, real-world financial tasks.  The methodology combines human expert evaluations with dynamic, task-specific interactions simulating evolving financial scenarios. Results showed a strong correlation (0.78 Pearson coefficient) between benchmark scores and human preferences.  This implies UCFE effectively assesses LLM performance and user satisfaction in financial applications.  Mid-sized LLMs (7B-14B parameters) performed well, balancing computational efficiency and domain expertise.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does UCFE compare to existing financial benchmarks like FLARE in terms of task complexity and evaluation metrics? 2.  Could the dynamic interaction component of UCFE be adapted to evaluate LLMs in other domains requiring specialized knowledge and evolving scenarios? 3.  What specific improvements were observed in financial LLMs compared to their backbone models, and how can these improvements be attributed to the continued pre-training on financial corpora?  |

The model is fine-tuned using a masked diffusion loss and a cross-attention loss.  c) MagicTailor achieved state-of-the-art performance in component-controllable personalization, reaching 56.5% in text alignment (CLIP-T) based on a user study, exceeding other personalization methods by at least 40 percentage points.    d) AI practitioners can use MagicTailor to fine-tune T2I models for more nuanced and controlled image generation, enabling the customization of individual components of visual concepts from reference images.   Follow-up questions:  1. What is the computational cost (time and resources) of training MagicTailor compared to baseline personalization methods like DreamBooth and Textual Inversion?  2.  How does MagicTailor handle more complex concepts comprising multiple components or scenarios where the components overlap significantly in the reference images?  3.  Could the DM-Deg and DS-Bal techniques be adapted to improve fine-grained control in other generative tasks, such as image editing or video generation?  |
| NaturalBench: Evaluating Vision-Language Models on Natural Adversarial Samples (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14669) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.14669))| zixianma, Nyandwi, Lilymelon7, zhiqiulin, BaiqiL | a) The research investigates whether current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are truly effective, hypothesizing that they struggle with seemingly simple, natural image-question pairs. b) Researchers developed NaturalBench, a semi-automated benchmark with 10,000 human-verified VQA samples, using CLIP and ChatGPT to generate initial samples from natural image-text corpora, followed by human verification.  A vision-centric design using question/image pairs with alternating answers prevents "blind" solutions. c) Evaluations of 53 state-of-the-art VLMs on NaturalBench demonstrate that even the best models, like GPT-40, perform significantly below human accuracy (over 90%), achieving only 39.6% group accuracy. d) NaturalBench provides a more robust evaluation for VLMs, highlighting areas for improvement by identifying biases and assessing diverse visio-linguistic skills. This necessitates focusing on debiasing techniques and improving models’ compositional reasoning abilities in visio-linguistic tasks for AI practitioners.  Follow-up questions:  1.  What specific debiasing techniques, beyond adjusting the prediction threshold (τ), were explored in the Appendix, and how effective were they in improving performance on NaturalBench without requiring knowledge of image-question pairings? 2.  Can the NaturalBench benchmark generation methodology be adapted to create specialized datasets for evaluating specific visio-linguistic skills, allowing for targeted model improvement in areas like attribute binding or spatial reasoning? 3.  Given the computational cost of fine-tuning large models like GPT-40, are there more efficient methods for mitigating the identified biases, such as incorporating debiasing strategies directly into the model architecture or training process?  |
| SeerAttention: Learning Intrinsic Sparse Attention in Your LLMs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13276) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.13276))| Hayden Kwok-Hay So, tingcao, Daniel-Duda, CharyZeng, Retromonic | a) The paper investigates learning intrinsic attention sparsity in Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve efficiency, rather than relying on predefined patterns.  b) The authors introduce SeerAttention, an attention mechanism with a learnable gate (AttnGate) that identifies important blocks in attention maps, enabling block-sparse computation via a custom FlashAttention kernel.  AttnGate is trained using a max-pooled full attention map as ground truth, obtained through a modified FlashAttention kernel.  c)  SeerAttention achieves up to a 5.67x speedup compared to FlashAttention-2 at a 90% sparsity ratio and 32k context length, with minimal perplexity loss when integrated with YaRN for long-context fine-tuning.  d) AI practitioners can leverage SeerAttention to significantly accelerate LLM inference, particularly for long sequences, without substantial accuracy degradation, by integrating this learned sparsity approach into existing or new models.  Follow-up questions:  1. How easily can SeerAttention be integrated into existing LLM training frameworks and deployed to production environments? Are there specific hardware requirements or software dependencies? 2. The paper focuses on prefill attention; are there plans or insights into extending SeerAttention to the decoder phase of LLMs, and what performance gains might be expected? 3. What are the memory implications of using SeerAttention during training and inference compared to other sparse attention methods and dense attention?  |
| Are AI Detectors Good Enough? A Survey on Quality of Datasets With Machine-Generated Texts (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14677) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.14677))| Yury Chekhovich, Anastasia Voznyuk, German Gritsai, andriygav | a) The research investigated the quality of datasets used for training and evaluating AI-generated text detectors, questioning if high reported performance stems from dataset deficiencies.  b) The authors evaluated multiple datasets using several detection methods (DeBERTa classifier, DetectGPT, Binoculars), topological time series analysis of text embeddings, and adversarial text perturbations (synonym replacement, sentence shuffling). c) On the HC3 dataset, the KL-divergence of topological time series distributions for human and machine-generated texts was 0.053, indicating some separability but also suggesting potential dataset limitations. d) AI practitioners should be cautious about relying solely on benchmark results for AI text detectors, as high performance might be due to biases or low generalizability of the evaluation datasets rather than true detector efficacy.  The paper, however, does not provide clear guidelines or definitive criteria for assessing dataset quality for AI-generated text detection.   Follow-up questions:  1. What specific criteria or thresholds should be used for the proposed dataset evaluation metrics (KLTTS, Ashift, KLshuffle) to determine whether a dataset is of sufficient quality for training and evaluating AI text detectors? 2. How can the proposed evaluation methods be extended or adapted to assess datasets for more complex tasks like hybrid writing detection or authorship attribution? 3.  Can the authors elaborate on the limitations of KLTTS with short texts? What are the specific computational instability issues? How can those be addressed and applied for evaluating short generated texts?  |

DisCL then uses curriculum learning strategies to select appropriate data from this spectrum for different training stages.  c) On the iWildCam dataset, DisCL improved the out-of-distribution (OOD) and in-distribution (ID) macro-accuracy by 2.7% and 2.1%, respectively.  On ImageNet-LT, it improved tail-class accuracy from 4.4% to 23.64%.  d) AI practitioners can utilize DisCL to enhance the performance of image classifiers, particularly when dealing with challenging real-world datasets characterized by low quality or long-tailed class distributions. The demonstrated performance boost on tail classes suggests DisCL can significantly improve representation learning in data-scarce scenarios.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the computational cost of generating the synthetic data spectrum using DisCL compare to other data augmentation techniques, particularly for large datasets?  2.  Could the adaptive curriculum selection strategy in DisCL be improved by incorporating other metrics beyond prediction score progress, such as feature diversity or uncertainty estimates?  3. The paper mentions limitations regarding the quality of generated data being dependent on the diffusion model and filtering model. What specific steps could be taken to mitigate these dependencies and improve the overall robustness of DisCL?  |
| DAWN: Dynamic Frame Avatar with Non-autoregressive Diffusion Framework for Talking Head Video Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13726) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.13726))| dujun, Bazhu, page-xia, Limin-Lin, Hanbo-Cheng | a) The research aims to develop a faster, higher-quality method for generating talking-head videos from a single portrait image and an audio clip, addressing limitations of autoregressive and semi-autoregressive approaches.  b) The proposed DAWN framework uses a non-autoregressive diffusion model (A2V-FDM) to generate motion representations, disentangling lip movements from head pose and blinks, which are generated separately by a Pose and Blink generation Network (PBNet).  A two-stage curriculum learning strategy is employed for training.  c) DAWN achieved state-of-the-art performance on the CREMA and HDTF datasets, including a Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) score of 9.60 and a Beat Align Score (BAS) of 0.281 on HDTF.  d) AI practitioners can leverage DAWN for real-time or near real-time generation of dynamic-length talking head videos, potentially improving applications in virtual meetings, gaming, and film production by removing reliance on slow autoregressive methods.   Follow-up questions:  1.  How does the computational cost of DAWN during inference compare to autoregressive and semi-autoregressive methods, particularly for very long video sequences? 2.  What are the limitations of the proposed disentanglement of lip movements, head pose, and blinks, and how might these limitations impact the realism of generated videos in complex scenarios with diverse head and facial movements? 3. Could the two-stage curriculum learning approach be generalized to other video generation tasks beyond talking heads, and what modifications might be necessary for effective application in these different contexts?  |
| A Common Pitfall of Margin-based Language Model Alignment: Gradient Entanglement (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13828) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.13828))| Yue Wu, leqiliu, Edify-Kd2024, yokey, huiyuan23 | This paper investigates the unintended consequences of using margin-based losses for preference optimization in language model alignment. The authors analyze the training dynamics of various margin-based methods, including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on text summarization and sentiment classification tasks.  A key finding is the "gradient entanglement" effect, where changes in the chosen and rejected response log-probabilities are coupled through their gradient inner product.  In experiments on a sentiment classification task, the chosen log probability increased with single-token responses, but decreased with longer suffix responses. This finding directly impacts alignment procedures as increasing the margin between preferred and dispreferred responses does not guarantee improved alignment and can even worsen performance on certain responses.  Follow-up questions:  1. How can the proposed pairwise normalized gradient descent or sparsity regularized token masking methods be efficiently implemented in large-scale language model training? 2. What are the trade-offs between using margin-based methods versus alternative alignment strategies, especially in safety-critical applications where minimizing the probability of undesirable responses is paramount? 3. How does gradient entanglement influence the performance of reward models in traditional RLHF pipelines where reward modeling and policy optimization are distinct stages?  |
| DPLM-2: A Multimodal Diffusion Protein Language Model (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13782) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.13782))| Dongyu Xue, Fei Ye, Zaixiang Zheng, Xinyou Wang, thughost | a) The research aimed to develop a multimodal protein foundation model capable of simultaneously modeling, understanding, and generating both protein sequences and structures.  b) DPLM-2 extends the discrete diffusion protein language model (DPLM) by incorporating structure information via a lookup-free quantizer (LFQ) tokenizer and training on experimental and synthetic structure data, using a warmup strategy from pre-trained DPLM and a self-mixup training strategy.  c) DPLM-2 achieves competitive performance in unconditional structure-sequence co-generation, with a self-consistency TM-score (scTM) exceeding 0.9 for most generated proteins across various lengths. It also demonstrated competitive ability in folding, inverse folding, and motif scaffolding.  d) AI practitioners can leverage DPLM-2 for various protein engineering tasks involving simultaneous sequence and structure generation or manipulation. The demonstration of effective multimodal training using discrete tokenized structure data provides a blueprint for other applications involving joint modeling of discrete and continuous data.  Follow-up questions:  1. What are the limitations of the LFQ tokenizer regarding the potential loss of fine-grained structural information, and how might these limitations impact downstream applications requiring precise structural details?  2.  How does the performance of DPLM-2's structure-aware representations compare to existing dedicated structure-based models in downstream tasks beyond those presented in the paper, and what are the trade-offs between using DPLM-2 versus a specialized model for specific structure-related tasks?  3.  Given the observed length extrapolation capabilities, what is the impact of training dataset length distribution and maximum length on the performance and stability of DPLM-2 when generating substantially longer sequences and structures exceeding those encountered during training?  |
| Context is Key(NMF): Modelling Topical Information Dynamics in Chinese Diaspora Media (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12791) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.12791))| Mette Thunø, Rebecca M. M. Hicke, Ross Deans Kristensen-McLachlan, kardosdrur | a) The research investigates potential PRC influence on European elections through Chinese diaspora media by analyzing how PRC narratives are represented and thus the objectives of PRC news media manipulation. b) The study uses a novel dynamic topic modeling pipeline combining KeyNMF, a transformer-based contextual embedding approach for topic extraction with Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and measures of novelty and resonance to analyze Chinese news articles. c) KeyNMF achieved higher external coherence scores compared to traditional and some contemporary topic models (e.g., LDA, NMF) on most of the tested corpora, exceeding LDA and NMF considerably. d) This research presents KeyNMF as a potentially more effective approach for topic modeling, especially in multilingual or data-scarce settings, offering AI practitioners a new tool for contextualized topic extraction and analysis of information dynamics.    Follow-up questions:  1.  How does KeyNMF's performance compare to BERTopic or other dynamic topic models specifically in terms of computational cost and scalability for large datasets? 2.  What are the limitations of using KeyNMF with other languages besides Chinese, considering the reliance on jieba tokenizer, a Chinese-specific tool? 3.  Can the observed correlation between novelty/resonance signals and political events be used to predict future similar reactions or is further research needed to establish causality?  |
| How Do Training Methods Influence the Utilization of Vision Models? (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14470) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.14470))| Janis Keuper, Margret Keuper, Shashank Agnihotri, Paul Gavrikov | This research investigates how different training methods affect the criticality of layers in ResNet-50 ImageNet-1k classification models.  The study randomized individual layer parameters and measured the cosine distance between the original and randomized output probability vectors to determine layer criticality. Results showed that training methods significantly influence layer criticality; for instance, a spatial convolution layer ([3.5] conv2) exhibited an average criticality of 36% but reached 95% when trained with PixMix.  While some layers, like the initial stem convolution and classification head, were always critical, no layer was consistently auxiliary across all training methods. This implies that AI practitioners should consider training methodology when assessing the relative importance of different layers for a given task, as certain training methods may under-utilize specific layers, affecting potential optimization strategies like pruning or distillation.   Follow-up questions:  1. How do these findings translate to other architectures beyond ResNet-50, such as vision transformers or ConvNeXt models? 2.  The paper mentions a correlation between criticality and generalization suggested by prior work, but finds a weak correlation on their dataset. How might this correlation change with different datasets or evaluation metrics beyond ImageNet accuracy? 3.  Could layer criticality analysis be integrated into the training process itself to dynamically adjust resource allocation or pruning strategies during training?  |

Multi-stage training with progressive resolution scaling and supervised fine-tuning was employed for video generation. c)  MovieGen outperformed existing models on text-to-video generation, achieving a 35.02% net win rate against Runway Gen3 on overall video quality.  It is unclear from the paper if these are cherry-picked examples or comprehensive benchmarks. d) AI practitioners can leverage MovieGen’s architecture and training techniques to develop high-quality video generation and editing models, pushing the state-of-the-art in media generation and manipulation.  The focus on scaling data, model size, and compute resources highlights the importance of these factors for achieving superior results in generative AI for media.   Follow-up questions:  1. The paper mentions using Flow Matching.  What specific implementation details and hyperparameters were used for this objective function, and how were they tuned for optimal performance across different datasets and model sizes?  2.

| Harnessing Webpage UIs for Text-Rich Visual Understanding (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13824) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.13824))| Yuxiao Qu, Yifan Song, yuexiang96, oottyy, jeepliu | a) This research aims to improve text-rich visual understanding in multimodal large language models (MLLMs).  b) The authors construct MultiUI, a 7.3-million-sample dataset synthesized from 1 million website UIs using text-based LLMs to generate multimodal instructions paired with UI screenshots. The dataset covers nine tasks across three categories: visual understanding and reasoning, text recognition, and grounding.  Models are then trained on MultiUI and tested on both web UI and general multimodal benchmarks.  c) Models trained on MultiUI achieve up to a 48% improvement on VisualWebBench and generalize to non-web UI domains like document understanding and chart interpretation, indicating the broader applicability of web UI data.  d) AI practitioners can leverage web UI data as a powerful resource for training MLLMs in text-rich visual understanding, enabling models to perform well across a broader range of tasks beyond just web UI-specific scenarios. The surprising generalization to non-UI domains highlights the potential for cross-domain knowledge transfer when using this type of data.    Follow-up questions:  1.  What specific techniques were used to clean and process the accessibility trees to ensure they were suitable for LLM processing, and how did this impact the quality of the generated instructions?  2.  While the paper demonstrates promising cross-domain generalization, what are the limitations of this approach, and what further research could be done to mitigate these limitations, particularly in domains with visually distinct characteristics from web UIs?  3.  Could the methodology for creating synthetic training data from web UIs using LLMs be adapted or extended to create datasets for other multimodal tasks, such as video understanding or audio-visual scene analysis?  |

| Janus: Decoupling Visual Encoding for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13848) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.13848))| zdaxie, zizhpan, XCLiu, CNMaxwell, WuChengyue | a) The paper investigates whether decoupling visual encoding for multimodal understanding and generation tasks within a unified model improves performance compared to using a single visual encoder. b) The researchers developed Janus, a unified autoregressive transformer model employing separate visual encoders for understanding (SigLIP) and generation (VQTokenizer) tasks, trained in a three-stage process involving adaptor and image head training, unified pretraining, and supervised fine-tuning. c) Janus achieved 69.4 on the MMBench benchmark, outperforming other unified models of comparable size and even some larger, task-specific models. d) The results suggest that AI practitioners building unified multimodal models should consider decoupling visual encoding pathways to potentially improve performance, particularly in understanding tasks, without significant performance degradation in generation tasks.   Follow-up questions:  1. What is the computational overhead of using two separate visual encoders compared to a single encoder, and how does this impact practical deployment? 2. Could other encoding methods besides SigLIP and VQTokenizer be more optimal for specific understanding or generation tasks within the Janus framework?  3. How does the performance of Janus scale with different LLM sizes, and what are the limitations of using smaller LLMs in this decoupled architecture?  |
| MMed-RAG: Versatile Multimodal RAG System for Medical Vision Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13085) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.13085))| Weijia Shi, Tianze Wang, Haoran Li, Kangyu Zhu, richardxp888 | This research addresses the issue of factual hallucinations in Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs). The authors propose MMed-RAG, a multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system incorporating domain-aware retrieval, adaptive context selection, and RAG-based preference fine-tuning.  On medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) and report generation tasks across five datasets, MMed-RAG improved the factual accuracy of Med-LVLMs by an average of 18.5% for VQA and 69.1% for report generation compared to the original Med-LVLM.  This suggests that MMed-RAG's components effectively mitigate misalignment issues introduced by incorporating retrieved knowledge.  AI practitioners can leverage MMed-RAG to improve the factuality and reliability of Med-LVLMs for real-world medical applications.  Follow-up questions:  1. What are the specific architectural details of the domain identification module within the domain-aware retrieval mechanism, and how is its performance evaluated in isolation? 2.  How does the computational cost of MMed-RAG during inference compare to the original Med-LVLM and other baseline methods, considering the overhead of retrieval and context selection? 3.  How robust is MMed-RAG to noisy or incomplete retrieved contexts, and what mitigation strategies could be employed to further enhance its reliability in such scenarios?  |
| A Unified View of Delta Parameter Editing in Post-Trained Large-Scale Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13841) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.13841))| Keming Lu, Hongyu Lin, Bowen Yu, Le Yu, TangQiaoYu | a) This paper aims to establish a unified framework for understanding how various delta parameter editing operations (pruning, quantization, etc.) affect the performance of post-trained large-scale models.  b) The research analyzes delta parameter editing through the lens of Riemann sum approximation of the loss function difference between post-trained and edited models.  c)  Experiments on ViT, LLaMA 3, Qwen 2, and Mistral models showed that DARE can eliminate up to 99% of delta parameters while maintaining competitive performance.  The paper doesn't provide enough quantitative detail to compare other editing operations besides DARE across all models and datasets tested.  d) AI practitioners can use the Riemann sum approximation framework to predict the performance impact of different delta parameter editing techniques and to design new editing methods for improved model compression or performance enhancement. The impact is especially relevant for model compression, as demonstrated by the success of DARE in significantly reducing model size without substantial performance loss.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the choice of the constant *C* in the Riemann sum approximation affect the accuracy of the performance predictions for different model architectures and datasets?  2. Can the proposed framework be extended to analyze the effects of delta parameter editing in the context of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods?  3.  Beyond the average magnitude, what other holistic statistics of delta parameters could be explored in the quantization approach, and how can we systematically evaluate their effectiveness?  |
| PopAlign: Diversifying Contrasting Patterns for a More Comprehensive Alignment (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13785) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.13785))| Ke Xu, Jiaheng Liu, Shawn Wang, Zekun Moore Wang, kangz | a) The research investigates how to construct more comprehensive and diversified contrasting patterns to enhance preference data for large language model (LLM) alignment and verifies the impact of diversifying these patterns.  b) PopAlign, a framework integrating six contrasting strategies across prompt, model, and pipeline levels, is proposed to synthesize preference-contrastive data without additional feedback labeling.  The models are then trained using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).  c) PopAlign achieved a 19.0% win rate against GPT-3.5 on AlpacaEval 2.0 (length-controlled), compared to 11.8% for the base Yi-6B-Chat model.  d) AI practitioners can leverage PopAlign to create more comprehensive alignment datasets, potentially leading to more robust and less susceptible LLMs by distilling diversified contrasting patterns across the response generation workflow.  The paper suggests "Elicitive Contrast" is particularly effective.  e)  The paper mentions using Yi-34B-Chat and Vicuna-33B for Leaderboard Contrast, citing a training data quality gap as the main performance differentiator. It is unclear whether other factors (e.g., architecture, training methodology) were controlled for.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does PopAlign's performance scale with larger LLMs and datasets, and what are the computational resource implications? 2. Can the "Elicitive Contrast" strategy be further optimized or adapted for different LLM architectures or tasks? 3. How robust is PopAlign to adversarial attacks aimed at exploiting specific contrasting patterns?  |
| MoH: Multi-Head Attention as Mixture-of-Head Attention (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11842) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.11842))| Shuicheng Yan, Li Yuan, Bo Zhu, Chat-UniVi | This research aims to improve the efficiency of multi-head attention in Transformer models while maintaining or exceeding accuracy. The authors propose Mixture-of-Head attention (MoH), which uses a router to select a subset of attention heads for each token and employs a weighted summation of the selected heads' outputs.  Experiments with MoH-LLaMA3-8B showed an average accuracy of 64.0% across 14 benchmarks, a 2.4% improvement over LLaMA3-8B while using only 75% of the attention heads. This implies that MoH can enable more efficient use of computational resources in attention-based models without sacrificing performance.

This is achieved through layer-wise feature distillation, class-specific feature distillation, and score distillation, combined with a mixture-of-agents gating mechanism for knowledge integration.  c) On 11 visual recognition benchmarks under a base-to-novel generalization setting, TransAgent, using CLIP ViT-B/16, outperforms CoOp by approximately 10% on average and 20% on EuroSAT.  d) AI practitioners can leverage TransAgent to improve the performance of CLIP-like models in diverse downstream tasks, particularly under low-shot conditions, without incurring additional computational cost in the inference phase due to the distillation approach. The paper does not explicitly detail the computational cost of the training/distillation phase.  Follow-up questions:  1. What is the computational overhead of the TransAgent training process compared to standard prompt tuning methods, and what are the trade-offs in terms of resource utilization?  2.  How does the performance of TransAgent scale with the number and diversity of the incorporated agent models, and are there limitations to integrating an even wider range of agents?  3. Could the TransAgent framework be adapted for other VLM architectures beyond CLIP, and what modifications would be necessary?  |

| HumanEval-V: Evaluating Visual Understanding and Reasoning Abilities of Large Multimodal Models Through Coding Tasks (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12381) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.12381))| Xiao Li, Guancheng Lin, Huiyu Bai, Linquan Wu, zfj1998 | a) The paper investigates the visual understanding and reasoning abilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in coding tasks that require visual context.  b) The researchers created HumanEval-V, a benchmark of 108 Python coding tasks adapted from existing problems and requiring LMMs to generate code solutions based on images and function signatures, evaluated using pass@k metrics.  c) State-of-the-art LMMs performed below expectations, with even proprietary models like GPT-4o achieving only 13% pass@1 on HumanEval-V.  d)  AI practitioners developing LMMs should focus on improving models' visual understanding and reasoning as well as coding proficiencies, as current models demonstrate significant weaknesses in integrating these skills.  e) The paper notes a consistent performance degradation in open-weight LMMs compared to their language-only decoder counterparts on coding benchmarks, highlighting a need for further improvement in multimodal training strategies.   Follow-up questions:  1.  The paper mentions "hallucination errors" due to overfitting. Could the authors elaborate on the specific types of hallucinations observed and how they relate to the adaptation process used in creating HumanEval-V?  2.  Given the limited improvement from zero-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting, what other reasoning or prompting techniques could be explored to better assist LMMs in solving these visual coding tasks?  3. What specific architectural changes or training strategies could be implemented to address the performance degradation observed in open-weight LMMs compared to their decoder counterparts on coding tasks?  |
| VidEgoThink: Assessing Egocentric Video Understanding Capabilities for Embodied AI (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11623) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.11623))| Sicheng Zhou, Yangyang Yu, Kechen Fang, yetian, SijieCheng | a) The research assesses the capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in understanding egocentric videos for application in Embodied AI tasks.  b) A new benchmark, VidEgoThink, was created with four interrelated tasks: video question-answering, hierarchy planning, visual grounding, and reward modeling; data was generated using Ego4D and GPT-40, then filtered by human annotators; and 14 MLLMs across three categories (API-based, open-source image-based, and open-source video-based) were evaluated.  c)  MLLMs performed poorly across all tasks, with the best average accuracy on video question-answering reaching only 32.82% across all dimensions.  d) The findings indicate current MLLMs require significant improvement for effective application in first-person scenarios in Embodied AI, particularly in understanding temporal dynamics and generating actionable outputs, despite having certain potential for advancement.   Follow-up Questions:  1.  Given the poor performance on temporal reasoning tasks, what specific architectural modifications or training strategies could be explored to improve MLLMs' ability to understand action sequences and temporal relations in egocentric videos?  2.  The paper mentions an automatic data generation pipeline; it would be useful to know more specific details of this pipeline.  Could the authors elaborate on the specific prompts used for GPT-40 and the filtering criteria employed by the human annotators to improve replicability and allow further exploration of this data generation approach?  3. The paper briefly mentions future work on developing egocentric foundation models for robotics.  What specific robotic tasks are the authors envisioning these models being applied to, and what are the key challenges they anticipate in adapting VidEgoThink or similar benchmarks for evaluating these specialized models?  |
| The Curse of Multi-Modalities: Evaluating Hallucinations of Large Multimodal Models across Language, Visual, and Audio (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12787) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.12787))| Hang Zhang, Yang Zhou, Yun Xing, Sicong Leng, ClownRat | a) This paper investigates the causes and prevalence of hallucinations in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) processing language, visual, and audio data.  b) A new benchmark called "The Curse of Multi-Modalities" (CMM) was created, using object/event-level probing questions in a binary classification framework to evaluate LMM performance across various multimodal contexts and hallucination subcategories.  c)  LMMs exhibit significant vulnerabilities to Audio-Language (AL) hallucinations, with Gemini-1.5-pro achieving only a 14.5% Hallucination Resistance (HR) score in this category.  d)  AI practitioners should prioritize addressing spurious inter-modality correlations, especially those involving audio, and mitigate the overreliance on unimodal priors when developing and deploying LMMs. The specific training strategies mentioned (balanced multi-modal training data, advanced cross-modal fusion, mitigating linguistic priors, and refined safety alignment) could be beneficial.   Follow-up Questions:  1.  The paper highlights the limited availability of visual-audio-language datasets as a potential reason for stronger AL correlations.  Are there recommended strategies or resources for constructing or augmenting such datasets to improve AL hallucination resistance?  2.  Could the authors elaborate on the specific implementation details of the "dynamic fusion strategies" mentioned as a potential improvement for cross-modal fusion? What are some promising architectures or approaches for achieving more context-aware modality integration?  3.  The paper identifies varying response tendencies in different LMMs (overconfidence vs. excessive caution).  Are there specific evaluation metrics or techniques beyond PA and HR that could be used to better characterize and compare these tendencies, enabling a more nuanced understanding of their impact on downstream tasks?  |
| Revealing the Barriers of Language Agents in Planning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12409) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.12409))| Kai Zhang, Siyu Yuan, jiangjiechen, kexunz, hsaest | This paper investigates why language agents struggle with planning tasks.  Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) analysis of constraint and question components within prompts was used. The results show that constraints have a limited role, and the influence of the question decreases with increasing planning horizon; OpenAI's 01 model achieves only 15.6% on the TravelPlanner benchmark.  This implies that current memory updating strategies for language agents, while offering some improvements, resemble "shortcut learning" and do not fully address the core issues of constraint integration and long-horizon goal maintenance.    Follow up questions:  1. How does the PFI analysis method account for the variability in the natural language generation process of LLMs across different prompts and trials? 2. How can the insights regarding the limitations of episodic and parametric memory updating inform the development of more effective memory mechanisms for language agents specifically aimed at improving planning performance? 3.  Can the observed weakness in constraint handling be addressed by incorporating symbolic planning techniques within the LLM framework for agent planning?  |
| DocLayout-YOLO: Enhancing Document Layout Analysis through Diverse Synthetic Data and Global-to-Local Adaptive Perception (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12628) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.12628))| Conghui He, Bin Wang, Hengrui Kang, Zhiyuan Zhao | a) The research aims to improve the speed and accuracy of Document Layout Analysis (DLA) by addressing the trade-off between multimodal and unimodal methods.  b) The authors introduce DocLayout-YOLO, which uses a synthetic dataset (DocSynth-300K) generated by their Mesh-candidate BestFit algorithm and integrates a Global-to-Local Controllable Receptive Module (GL-CRM) within a YOLOv10 architecture.  c) DocLayout-YOLO achieved 78.8% mAP on the DocStructBench dataset with an inference speed of 85.5 frames per second (FPS).  d)  AI practitioners can leverage DocLayout-YOLO for real-time, accurate DLA in applications such as document parsing, information retrieval, and knowledge extraction, benefiting from its improved speed and accuracy compared to previous methods.   Follow-Up Questions:  1. What are the details of the GL-CRM's integration with the YOLOv10 architecture, and how does this module specifically contribute to the improved handling of multi-scale elements?  2. While the paper mentions that DocSynth-300K offers improved diversity, what are the limitations of this synthetic dataset, particularly when dealing with extremely complex or unusual document layouts not well-represented in the training data?  3.  Can the Mesh-candidate BestFit algorithm be adapted for other layout generation tasks beyond document layout analysis, such as webpage layout or UI design?  |
| Exploring Model Kinship for Merging Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12613) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.12613))| Huajun Chen, Shumin Deng, Ningyu Zhang, Yunzhi Yao, Yedi Hu | a) This research investigates whether a metric called "model kinship" (similarity between LLMs based on weight differences from a base model) can guide and improve the performance of iterative LLM merging.  b) The researchers analyzed open-source LLMs using Pearson Correlation, Cosine Similarity, and Euclidean Distance to calculate model kinship, correlating it with merging performance gains and examining its behavior across different merging stages. They also proposed a "Top-k Greedy Merging with Model Kinship" strategy that incorporates kinship into model selection for merging.  c)  A statistically significant correlation was found between the absolute value of merge gain and model kinship. Using the kinship-guided merging strategy, the researchers achieved an average task performance of 69.13 across six tasks, compared to 68.72 using a standard greedy strategy. It is unclear why the results focus on absolute merge gain rather than merge gain itself, and the choice and impact of merging six specific tasks is also not explained.  d) AI practitioners can utilize model kinship to guide model selection during iterative merging, potentially escaping local optima and achieving higher performance gains on multi-task learning benchmarks. Using model kinship also offers potential as an early stopping criterion in iterative merging, improving resource efficiency.   Follow-up questions:  1.  How does the choice of the base model affect the calculation and interpretation of model kinship, and what are best practices for base model selection? 2.  Beyond the six tasks used in this study, how does model kinship generalize to broader sets of tasks or different task domains, and what are the limitations of its applicability? 3.  Can the concept of model kinship be extended to guide other LLM combination techniques beyond simple weight averaging, such as knowledge distillation or parameter fusion?  |
| Large Language Model Evaluation via Matrix Nuclear-Norm (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10672) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.10672))| Yi Chang, Yahan Li, WhiteCatY, xiatingyu | This research aimed to develop a more computationally efficient metric for evaluating information compression and redundancy reduction in Large Language Models (LLMs).  The researchers proposed using the Matrix Nuclear-Norm, approximated by the L1,2-norm, as a computationally less expensive alternative to Matrix Entropy.  Results showed the Matrix Nuclear-Norm achieved speeds 8 to 24 times faster than Matrix Entropy for the CEREBRAS-GPT model with increasing sizes from 111M to 6.7B parameters. This improvement allows AI practitioners to more efficiently evaluate LLMs, especially as model sizes continue to scale, making the Matrix Nuclear-Norm a potentially practical choice for assessing compression capabilities. The paper does not definitively state whether Matrix Nuclear-Norm and Matrix Entropy yield comparable evaluation accuracy despite the stated claim of "comparable accuracy".  Follow-up questions:  1.  While the paper demonstrates computational efficiency gains, how does the Matrix Nuclear-Norm's correlation with downstream task performance compare to Matrix Entropy's? 2.  The paper mentions anomalies in Matrix Nuclear-Norm values for certain model sizes (2.7B and 13B). What are the potential underlying reasons for these anomalies and how might they affect the metric's reliability in evaluating these specific models? 3. How sensitive is the Matrix Nuclear-Norm to the choice of L1,2-norm approximation, and are there alternative approximations that might improve its accuracy or stability further?  |
| ProSA: Assessing and Understanding the Prompt Sensitivity of LLMs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12405) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.12405))| Dahua Lin, Xinyu Fang, KennyUTC, zsytony, JingmingZ | a) The research aimed to evaluate and understand prompt sensitivity in large language models (LLMs) at the instance level.  b) ProSA, a framework incorporating the PromptSensiScore (PSS) metric and leveraging decoding confidence, was developed.  c)  Results across multiple datasets and models revealed variations in prompt sensitivity, with Llama3-70B-Instruct exhibiting the highest robustness and Qwen1.5-14B-Chat demonstrating the most serious prompt sensitivity on the MATH dataset. d)  Higher model confidence correlated with increased prompt robustness, suggesting prompt sensitivity reflects the model's decoding logic. This finding provides a new metric for evaluating LLM robustness and emphasizes the importance of considering prompt engineering and selection strategies in development and applications.    Follow-up Questions:  1. How does the ProSA framework compare with existing methods for evaluating prompt sensitivity in terms of computational cost and insights provided? 2.  Could the decoding confidence be used as a signal for automated prompt optimization or selection? 3. How does the observed correlation between model size and prompt sensitivity vary across different model architectures (e.g., decoder-only vs. encoder-decoder)?   |
| ZipVL: Efficient Large Vision-Language Models with Dynamic Token Sparsification and KV Cache Compression (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08584) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.08584))| Wenqi Shao, Jing Liu, Feng Chen, Yefei He, kpzhang996 | a) The research aims to improve the efficiency of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by addressing computational bottlenecks in the prefill phase and memory bottlenecks in the decoding phase.  b) ZipVL employs a dynamic, layer-wise adaptive ratio assignment for important tokens based on attention score distribution, combined with token-level sparse attention in the prefill phase and mixed-precision KV cache quantization in the decoding phase.  c)  Experiments demonstrate a 2.6× speedup in the prefill phase and a 50.0% reduction in GPU memory usage on the LongVA-7B model for the Video-MME benchmark, with a 0.2% accuracy reduction.  d)  AI practitioners can leverage ZipVL to significantly improve the inference speed and reduce the memory footprint of LVLMs, facilitating their deployment in resource-constrained environments.  The dynamic ratio assignment, in particular, offers a more robust and adaptive approach compared to fixed sparsity methods.    Follow-up Questions:  1. What are the specific implementation details regarding the integration of ZipVL with different fast attention mechanisms besides FlashAttention?  2. How does the performance of ZipVL scale with increasing video lengths or image resolutions, particularly with regards to the trade-off between computational cost and accuracy?  3.  Could the dynamic ratio allocation strategy be further improved by incorporating factors beyond attention scores, such as textual context or visual saliency?  |
| Improving Long-Text Alignment for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11817) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.11817))| Chongxuan Li, Zehan Wang, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, luping-liu | a) This research addresses the challenge of aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with long, complex text prompts, which often exceed the token limits of standard encoders like CLIP and result in incomplete or inaccurate image generation.  b) The authors propose LongAlign, combining segment-level encoding, which divides long text into segments and processes them individually, with a decomposed preference optimization method that fine-tunes diffusion models using a reweighted combination of text-relevant and text-irrelevant preference scores derived from a modified CLIP-based model.  c) The fine-tuned Stable Diffusion (SD) v1.5 model, after 20 hours of training using LongAlign on 6 A100 GPUs, achieves a FID score of 19.63 on a 5k image dataset, outperforming baseline foundation models like PixArt-a and Kandinsky v2.2 in long-text alignment.  d) AI practitioners can leverage LongAlign to improve the fidelity of T2I generation from detailed text prompts by overcoming input length limitations and enhancing alignment between text and generated images. The decomposition of preference scores during fine-tuning helps mitigate overfitting, a common issue in reward-based optimization of diffusion models.   Follow-up questions:  1. What are the specific implementation details for merging the segment embeddings in LongAlign, especially regarding the choice of concatenation versus other aggregation methods, and how does this impact the computational complexity?  2. How does the reweighting factor *w* in the gradient-reweight reward fine-tuning affect the trade-off between text alignment and visual quality (e.g., aesthetics, photorealism), and is there a systematic method for determining the optimal *w* value for different datasets and models?  3.  How robust is LongAlign to variations in text segmentation strategies (e.g., sentence-level versus semantic chunk-level segmentation), and what preprocessing steps are necessary to ensure consistent performance across diverse text formats and domains?  |
| Simplifying, Stabilizing and Scaling Continuous-Time Consistency Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11081) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.11081))| Yang Song, Cheng Lu | a) This research aims to improve the training stability and scalability of continuous-time consistency models (CMs) for fast generative sampling.  b) The authors introduce TrigFlow, a simplified theoretical framework unifying diffusion and CM formulations, alongside improved network architecture, time-conditioning, and training objectives incorporating tangent normalization and adaptive weighting.  They also enhance Jacobian-vector product computation for Flash Attention to improve training efficiency.  c) The resulting simplified CMs (sCMs) achieved a 2-step FID score of 1.88 on ImageNet 512x512 with 1.5 billion parameters, narrowing the gap to state-of-the-art diffusion models to within 10%.  d) AI practitioners can leverage these stabilized and scalable continuous-time CMs for high-quality image generation with significantly reduced sampling compute compared to traditional diffusion models.  The simplification provided by TrigFlow could also make CMs more accessible for development and analysis.   Follow-up questions:  1. Could the TrigFlow framework be adapted for other data modalities beyond images, such as audio or 3D models, and what modifications might be necessary?  2. What are the practical memory and compute requirements for training sCMs at the reported scale, and how do they compare to training comparable diffusion models?  3. How sensitive are the sCM results to the hyperparameters introduced for tangent normalization and adaptive weighting, and are there recommended starting points for tuning these on new datasets?  |
| Insights from the Inverse: Reconstructing LLM Training Goals Through Inverse RL (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12491) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.12491))| Sonali Parbhoo, Arjun Jagota, Jared Joselowitz, skrishna | This research investigated whether Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can recover the reward functions underlying the training of Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).  The researchers applied a Max-Margin IRL algorithm to extract reward models from toxicity-aligned LLMs of varying sizes (70M and 410M parameters), trained on a subset of the Jigsaw toxicity dataset. The extracted reward model for the 70M parameter LLM achieved 80.40% accuracy in predicting human preferences on a held-out test set.  This indicates that, at least for smaller models and specific tasks, IRL can extract reward models that capture key aspects of the original RLHF objective, which has implications for interpretability and potential vulnerability analysis. The paper mentions challenges with the non-identifiability of reward functions and potential scalability issues for larger LLMs but does not fully elaborate on mitigations or solutions.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does the performance of the proposed Max-Margin IRL method compare to other IRL techniques, such as Max-Entropy or adversarial IRL, in extracting reward models from RLHF-trained LLMs, especially for larger models and more complex reward structures?  2.  What specific mitigation strategies are proposed to address the non-identifiability of the recovered reward functions, and how do these impact the reliability and interpretability of the extracted models for practical applications like debugging or bias detection?  3. Given the potential for misuse of extracted reward models, what concrete recommendations would the researchers offer for responsible disclosure and use of these models within the broader AI community?  |
| Neural Metamorphosis (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11878) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.11878))| Xinchao Wang, Xingyi Yang | This paper aims to create self-morphable neural networks adaptable to various sizes without retraining. The key methodology involves training a neural implicit function (INR) as a hypernetwork to learn the continuous weight manifold of neural networks, incorporating strategies for intra- and cross-network smoothness.  On CIFAR10 image classification, the proposed method, NeuMeta, achieved 91.76% accuracy with a full-sized ResNet20 and 89.56% accuracy at a 75% compression rate, often outperforming individually trained models at smaller sizes. This implies that AI practitioners could potentially achieve significant model compression without retraining or substantial performance loss.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does the computational cost of using the INR to generate weights compare to the cost of fine-tuning a pruned model or training a smaller model from scratch, especially for very large networks? 2.  The paper mentions limitations in the INR's representational ability for complex tasks like segmentation; how might these limitations be addressed to improve performance on such tasks at higher compression rates? 3. Could NeuMeta be extended to enable dynamic morphing of network architectures during inference based on resource availability or input characteristics?  |
| WorldMedQA-V: a multilingual, multimodal medical examination dataset for multimodal language models evaluation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12722) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.12722))| Juan Carlos Climent Pardo, Yingya Li, Siena Placino, João Matos, shanchen | a) The research aimed to create and evaluate a multilingual, multimodal benchmark dataset to assess vision-language models (VLMs) in healthcare question answering (QA).  b)  Researchers collected multiple-choice medical exam questions from Brazil, Israel, Japan, and Spain, pairing them with images and validating English translations. They then evaluated the performance of 10 open and closed-source VLMs with and without image input, using accuracy as the metric, and calculated Cohen's kappa for cross-linguistic consistency.  c)  GPT4o achieved the highest accuracy across most datasets, but only reached 58% accuracy on the Hebrew version of the Israeli dataset.  d)  The results indicate a need for improvement in VLMs' ability to handle diverse languages, especially those underrepresented in training data, as demonstrated by lower performance in non-Roman alphabet languages like Hebrew.  The impact of image input varied significantly across model families, with Gemini models showing the largest performance gains.  Follow-up questions:  1. What specific pre-training datasets were used for the evaluated VLMs, and what is their representation of different languages and medical concepts?  2.  How does the performance of the VLMs on this multiple-choice dataset compare to their performance on other medical QA tasks, such as free-text generation or information retrieval?  3. Beyond accuracy and Cohen's Kappa, what other metrics (e.g., calibration, robustness, fairness) would be relevant to evaluate VLMs in this context, and were they examined in the research?  |
| OMCAT: Omni Context Aware Transformer (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12109) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.12109))| Andrew Tao, Rafael Valle, Matthieu Le, Karan Sapra, goarushi27 | a) This research aims to improve cross-modal temporal understanding in multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly the ability to correlate events across audio and video streams.  b) The authors introduce a new dataset, OCTAV (Omni Context and Temporal Audio Video), designed to capture event transitions across audio and video, and a new model, OMCAT (Omni Context Aware Transformer), which leverages Rotary Time Embeddings (ROTE) for enhanced temporal grounding.  OMCAT is trained using a three-stage pipeline: feature alignment, instruction tuning, and OCTAV-specific training.  c) OMCAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) tasks, outperforming existing models by a substantial margin on the OCTAV benchmark (19.0% Recall@1 IoU 0.7 on OCTAV-ST-ActivityNet for OMCAT vs 1.57% for GroundingGPT). It also shows competitive results in zero-shot settings.  d) AI practitioners can leverage OMCAT and the OCTAV dataset to develop more robust multimodal applications requiring fine-grained temporal understanding, such as video analysis, content creation, and interactive media. The improved performance on time-anchored tasks directly enhances the ability of LLMs to understand and generate temporally consistent responses in multimodal contexts.   Follow-up questions:  1.  What are the computational costs and scalability implications of ROTE compared to other temporal embedding methods, especially when applied to longer videos or higher-resolution data? 2.  How does the performance of OMCAT degrade with noisier or more ambiguous audio-visual data, which is common in real-world scenarios not represented in the artificially constructed OCTAV dataset?  3.  Can the ROTE embeddings be effectively generalized to other multimodal tasks beyond audio-visual understanding, such as integrating text, images, and sensor data with time dependencies?  |
| Tracking Universal Features Through Fine-Tuning and Model Merging (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12391) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.12391))| Desmond Elliott, nilq | a) This research investigates how features in one-layer Transformer language models evolve (emerge, disappear, persist) during fine-tuning to new domains and model merging via spherical linear interpolation. b) The study uses small-scale Mistral-like Transformers trained on English text and programming code (Python and Lua), with feature extraction performed using sparse autoencoders analyzing MLP activations. c) Few features persist across fine-tuning and merging, though persistent features often correspond to generic text properties like punctuation and formatting (e.g., a variable assignment feature maintained an average 85.1% cross-correlation across models).   d)  AI practitioners can leverage these findings to understand feature dynamics when adapting existing models for new domains or tasks using fine-tuning and merging techniques. The low feature persistence suggests that substantial feature change is expected when applying these techniques, and monitoring/analysis of these changes may be crucial.   Follow-up Questions:  1. How do the findings generalize to larger, more complex Transformer models used in real-world applications? 2. Are there alternative merging techniques or hyperparameter settings that could improve feature retention during merging? 3.  Could controlling or manipulating these evolving features during fine-tuning and merging lead to more robust and adaptable models?  |
| DyVo: Dynamic Vocabularies for Learned Sparse Retrieval with Entities (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07722) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.07722))| Jeff Dalton, Iain Mackie, Sean MacAvaney, Shubham Chatterjee, Thong Nguyen | This paper investigates whether incorporating entities into learned sparse retrieval (LSR) improves its effectiveness. The researchers introduce a Dynamic Vocabulary (DyVo) head, which uses entity embeddings and an entity retrieval component to generate entity weights, merged with word piece weights to create joint representations.  On the CODEC dataset, DyVo with GPT-4 generated entity candidates achieves an nDCG@10 of 56.46, compared to 52.61 for LSR without entities. This implies that augmenting LSR with dynamically retrieved entities can improve retrieval effectiveness, especially in entity-rich datasets. AI practitioners working with LSR can use the DyVo head to expand vocabularies with entities from external knowledge bases, potentially increasing performance.  Follow-up questions:  1. What is the computational overhead of the entity retrieval component, especially at scale with large knowledge bases? 2. How robust is the method to different entity embedding sources, and how can embedding quality be efficiently evaluated within this framework? 3. What strategies could be employed to further reduce the dependence on computationally expensive large language models for candidate generation during training and inference?  |

| MLLM can see? Dynamic Correction Decoding for Hallucination Mitigation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11779) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.11779))| Haoming Xu, Bozhong Tian, Xiang Chen, Chenxi Wang, Ningyu | a) This research investigates the mechanism of hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and proposes a mitigation method. b) The authors analyze MLLM behavior through object probing, probability analysis across transformer layers, and early exit experiments, then introduce Dynamic Correction Decoding with preCeding-Layer Knowledge (DeCo). DeCo dynamically selects preceding layers with higher ground truth token confidence and integrates their knowledge into the final layer output logits.  c) DeCo reduces hallucination rates on the CHAIR benchmark by an average of 10.8% compared to baselines across various MLLMs and decoding strategies. d)  AI practitioners can use DeCo as a training-free decoding method to mitigate hallucinations in MLLMs during inference, potentially improving the reliability of generated content in image captioning and VQA tasks.  This is particularly relevant for applications where factual accuracy is critical.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does DeCo's performance compare to existing training-based hallucination mitigation methods in terms of both accuracy and computational cost? 2.  Can DeCo be effectively combined with other decoding strategies or post-processing methods for further hallucination reduction? 3.

The authors introduce SimBa, a novel RL network architecture combining running statistics normalization, a residual feedforward block, and post-layer normalization.  Experiments across various RL algorithms and 51 continuous control tasks show SimBa consistently improves sample efficiency.  Specifically, SimBa with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods on the DMC, MyoSuite, and HumanoidBench benchmarks, achieving an average return of 706 points on the DMC Hard benchmark.

The generalist and specialist are trained separately with potentially different datasets. c) RoboDual achieved a 12% performance improvement on CALVIN and a 20% increase over the most competitive baseline in a real-world setting across a range of manipulation tasks. It also maintained strong performance with only 5% of demonstration data and enabled a 3.8x higher control frequency compared to the generalist alone. d) AI practitioners can leverage RoboDual to efficiently deploy large VLA models for real-world robotic manipulation tasks by combining them with lightweight and adaptable specialist models. The dual-system approach can potentially improve performance, efficiency, and adaptability in data-constrained environments.  Follow-up questions:  1.

The researchers curated a 20K multimodal dataset, MMIE, from existing sources, spanning diverse fields and including multiple-choice and open-ended questions. They fine-tuned InternVL-2-4B with a human-annotated scoring dataset to create an automated evaluation metric.  The best-performing integrated LVM (GPT-40 + SDXL) achieved a score of 65.47% on MMIE, indicating significant room for improvement in the field.  This suggests to practitioners that current interleaved LVLMs and integrated LVLMs have substantial limitations in tasks requiring both image and text understanding and generation, even with advanced models.  Follow-up Questions:  1. How does the performance of the fine-tuned InternVL-2-4B scoring model compare to human evaluation on a larger, unseen test set, and what are the specific strengths and weaknesses of the automated metric observed in such a comparison?  2.  What are the specific error modes of the different LVLMs evaluated across the categories and fields in MMIE, and how can these insights be used to inform the development of more robust and capable models? 3.  What is the distribution of question types (e.g., multiple-choice vs. open-ended, complexity of reasoning required) within each of the 12 fields of MMIE, and how does this distribution influence the performance variations observed across different LVLMs?  |

The benchmark revealed model biases, a lack of expert domain knowledge in some LMMs, and unbalanced multimodal capabilities, with superior performance in image and text modalities but weaker performance in 3D and audio.  This suggests focusing on improved training and architecture design for LMMs, especially in less common modalities, and further developing methods to mitigate model bias.   Follow-up questions:  1.  How does the performance of LMMs vary when fine-tuning on specific domain datasets within LOKI, particularly for categories like satellite imagery and medical images where a lack of expert knowledge was observed?  2.  What specific architectural changes or training strategies could be employed to address the unbalanced multimodal capabilities observed, particularly the relatively poor performance on 3D and audio data?  3.  Does the observed model bias (tendency to favor either synthetic or real data) correlate with any specific training data characteristics or model architectures, and what mitigation strategies could be explored to improve unbiased decision-making?  |

The authors developed VIF-RAG, a verifiable automated data synthesis pipeline combining augmented instruction rewriting with multiple validation processes, including code-based verification.  VIF-RAG significantly improved performance on the FollowRAG benchmark, achieving an average of 52.2% instruction-following accuracy on the Natural Questions dataset compared to 38.8% for the Mistral-7B-SFT baseline.

Snoek, Manuel Mucientes, yukimasano, mdorkenw, dcores | a) The paper investigates the shortcomings of existing video-language benchmarks, particularly focusing on their lack of emphasis on temporal understanding and the presence of spatial and textual biases, proposing a new benchmark as a solution.  b) The authors analyze existing benchmarks like MVBench by evaluating the performance of text-only, image-only, and video models on original and manipulated (shuffled, reversed) videos. They also assess open-ended question-answering benchmarks and their evaluation using LLMs. They then introduce TVBench, a new multiple-choice question-answering video benchmark designed to require temporal reasoning.  c) Image-language model GPT-4o achieves 49% accuracy on the fine-grained action task in MVBench, comparable to state-of-the-art video models and surpassing random chance by 20.5% overall, demonstrating the benchmark's spatial bias.  Most recent state-of-the-art video-language models perform near randomly on TVBench, while Tarsier and Gemini 1.5 Pro clearly outperform this baseline, showcasing TVBench's ability to identify models with strong temporal understanding.  d)  AI practitioners developing video-language models should consider the limitations of existing benchmarks and incorporate TVBench into their evaluation pipelines to more accurately assess and improve the temporal understanding capabilities of their models.  e)  The paper doesn't quantitatively describe the performance drop of Tarsier and Gemini 1.5 Pro on shuffled/reversed TVBench videos, though it is mentioned qualitatively.

Data was collected using a whole-upper-body teleoperation system mapping human movements to a full-sized humanoid robot.  c) iDP3 outperformed baseline methods (Diffusion Policy with ResNet18, frozen R3M, and DP3 encoders) in unseen real-world scenarios and showed view invariance;  iDP3 achieved a 99/147 success rate on the Pick&Place task across four different setups in diverse real-world scenes after training on only one scene.  d) AI practitioners can utilize iDP3 to train generalizable visuomotor policies for humanoid robots without relying on complex camera calibration and point cloud segmentation, potentially simplifying real-world deployment. The paper strongly indicates the superiority of egocentric 3D representations for view invariance in robot manipulation.  Follow-Up Questions:  1.

Commercial chat assistants and long-context LLMs were evaluated.  c) Existing long-term memory systems and long-context LLMs exhibit significant performance degradation (30-60% accuracy drop) on LongMemEval compared to simpler memory tasks.  d)  AI practitioners should consider memory design choices (indexing, retrieval, and reading strategies) to improve long-term memory capabilities in chat assistants.

| From Generalist to Specialist: Adapting Vision Language Models via Task-Specific Visual Instruction Tuning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06456) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.06456))| Daniel Shu Wei Ting, Rick Siow Mong Goh, Jun Zhou, Yang Zhou, yangbai123 | This research explores whether Vision Language Models (VLMs) can match or exceed task-specific models (TSMs) in performance.  The authors introduce VITask, a framework that uses exemplar prompting (EP) with TSM features, response distribution alignment (RDA), and contrastive response tuning (CRT) to enhance VLM performance on specific tasks.  On the MedMNIST dataset, VITask with EP achieved the highest accuracy and F1 scores on 8 of 12 medical image diagnosis tasks. This suggests that integrating task-specific knowledge from TSMs significantly improves VLM performance on specialized tasks, even outperforming larger, more generally trained models.  AI practitioners can leverage VITask to efficiently adapt pre-trained VLMs for domain-specific applications without extensive retraining.  Follow-up questions:  1.  The paper mentions VITask's robustness to incomplete instructions, but the magnitude of this robustness isn't quantified beyond Figure 4. How does performance degrade with varying levels of instruction incompleteness across different tasks? 2.  The paper focuses on image classification.  How adaptable is the VITask framework to other vision-language tasks, such as visual question answering or image captioning, where defining a single TSM might be more complex? 3.  What are the computational resource requirements (e.g., GPU memory, training time) for implementing VITask compared to standard instruction tuning or end-to-end fine-tuning of VLMs?  |
| EvolveDirector: Approaching Advanced Text-to-Image Generation with Large Vision-Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07133) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.07133))| Yujie Wei, AnalMom, xiangwang1223, JacobYuan, ruizhaocv | This research explores training an open-source text-to-image model with public resources to achieve comparable capabilities to existing advanced models whose parameters and training data are proprietary.  The EvolveDirector framework trains a base diffusion transformer model using a dynamically updated dataset of image-text pairs generated by advanced models via their APIs. A large vision-language model (VLM) continuously evaluates the base model and refines the dataset through operations like discrimination, expansion, mutation, and deletion based on comparisons between the base model's output and the advanced model's output.  Results show the trained model, Edgen, outperforms the advanced models in human evaluation across general image generation and specific domains like human and text generation, achieving a 98.08% preference rate overall. This implies that practitioners can potentially replicate and even surpass the capabilities of closed-source advanced models using publicly available resources and strategic data curation guided by VLMs.   Follow-up questions:  1. What specific VLMs were used in the comparison study shown in Figure 4, and were they fine-tuned for this image evaluation task or used zero-shot?  More details on VLM prompting and evaluation would be helpful. 2. What are the computational costs and API expenses associated with training Edgen compared to training a model on a large static dataset like LAION? A cost breakdown would clarify the practical advantages of EvolveDirector. 3. The paper mentions instability in training with smaller datasets. What specific techniques, besides layer normalization after Q and K projections, were used to stabilize training and prevent mode collapse during multi-scale training? More details would be helpful to replicate the results.   |
| StructRAG: Boosting Knowledge Intensive Reasoning of LLMs via Inference-time Hybrid Information Structurization (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08815) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.08815))| Haiyang Yu, Xuanang Chen, Robin-Lee, xphan, lzq2021 | StructRAG aims to improve Large Language Model (LLM) performance on knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks by using a hybrid information structuring method.  The framework dynamically selects the optimal structure type (table, graph, algorithm, catalogue, or chunk) based on the task.  It then converts raw documents into this structured format and uses a structured knowledge utilizer to decompose complex questions and extract precise knowledge for inference. Experiments on the Loong benchmark show state-of-the-art performance, with improvements increasing with task complexity.  Follow-up questions: 1. What is the computational overhead of dynamically selecting and constructing different structure types during inference? 2.

The authors propose PositionID Prompting and PositionID Fine-Tuning, where unique identifiers are assigned to textual units (words, sentences, paragraphs) to enhance positional awareness during text generation.  For copy-paste, they introduce PositionID CP Prompting, a three-stage tool-use mechanism involving copy and paste tool calls with explicit positional parameters.  On the LenCtrl-Bench dataset, PositionID Prompting achieved a Rouge-L score of 23.2, outperforming other length control baselines. The paper's principal implication for AI practitioners is that explicit positional awareness can significantly improve LLM performance in length-controlled text generation and accurate copy-paste tasks.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does the performance of PositionID Fine-Tuning scale with model size and dataset variability? 2. What are the computational overhead and latency implications of incorporating PositionID techniques, particularly for real-time applications? 3.

| Mechanistic Permutability: Match Features Across Layers (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07656) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.07656))| Ian Maksimov, kefirski, elephantmipt | a) The paper investigates how interpretable features, extracted using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), evolve across the layers of a deep neural network (specifically, the Gemma 2 language model).  b) The researchers introduce SAE Match, a data-free method that aligns SAE features from different layers by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the "folded" parameters of the SAEs (incorporating activation thresholds).  They also use external LLM evaluations of feature descriptions and metrics like change in cross-entropy loss and explained variance when approximating hidden states with matched features.  c) The study found that matching SAE features using folded parameters improves alignment quality compared to not using folded parameters, as evidenced by lower MSE values and more "SAME" labels from LLM evaluations.  Specifically, unfolded matching resulted in consistently higher MSE values compared to folded matching across all tested SAE layers.  d) For AI practitioners, this research offers a method to track feature evolution and persistence through network layers, potentially improving interpretability and enabling techniques like layer pruning based on feature similarity.  The impact of SAE sparsity on feature matching is also explored, potentially guiding practitioners in choosing appropriate SAE configurations for analysis.  Follow-up questions:  1.  The paper mentions a performance drop in feature matching quality at the 10th layer.  What are the potential causes of this drop, and how can it be addressed? Does this layer represent a shift in the type of features being learned by the model? 2.  While the paper focuses on the Gemma 2 model, how generalizable is the SAE Match method to other architectures and model types? What modifications or adaptations might be necessary for effective application to different models? 3. Could the method be extended to support other interpretability techniques beyond Sparse Autoencoders? For example, could it be adapted to align features extracted by probing methods or other types of autoencoders?  |

Follow-up questions:  1.  What is the computational overhead of the multi-agent framework during pretraining, and how does it compare to the overhead of methods like MATES, which require recalculating influence scores?  2.  Could the multi-agent framework be adapted to incorporate other data selection heuristics beyond quality, domain, and topic, and what would be the key considerations for such an adaptation?  3. How sensitive are the overall performance gains to the choice of reference tasks and the optimization strategy for updating the agent and collaboration weights during training?  |

After prediction, inference continues solely with the base model.  c) On TriviaQA, KV Prediction achieves 15%-50% better accuracy retention compared to baselines at equal TTFT FLOP counts.  d)  AI practitioners can use KV Prediction to significantly improve the TTFT of large language models on edge devices, enabling a better user experience in latency-sensitive applications like chatbots without sacrificing much accuracy. The significant improvement in accuracy retention compared to token pruning methods provides a more robust approach to on-device LLM efficiency.  Follow-up questions:  1.

The EEEA (Exploration-Execution-Evaluation-Adjustment) pattern observed in agent trajectories offers valuable insights into LLM problem-solving approaches.   Follow-up Questions:  1. How does the performance of open-source LLMs on specific DA-Code task categories (e.g., data wrangling, machine learning) compare to closed-source models, and what factors might contribute to observed performance differences? 2.  Given the limited effectiveness of current LLMs in complex data scenarios like those presented in DA-Code, what specific research directions (e.g., enhanced training data, improved agent frameworks) are most promising for improving LLM performance on these types of tasks? 3.  Can the DA-Code benchmark be adapted or extended to evaluate other aspects of LLM agents beyond code generation, such as explanation generation or interactive data exploration capabilities?  |

Block-wise fine-tuning is also used to further refine the quantization parameters.  c) On a W4A4KV4 (4-bit weight, activation, and KV cache) quantized Llama-3-8B model, PrefixQuant achieved a 7.43 WikiText2 perplexity and 71.08% average accuracy on five common-sense reasoning tasks, outperforming previous dynamic quantization methods.  d) AI practitioners can utilize PrefixQuant to achieve faster and more memory-efficient LLM deployment through its per-tensor static quantization approach, exceeding the performance of existing dynamic quantization techniques without retraining. The paper specifically highlights increased inference speeds compared to previous approaches.   Follow-up questions:  1.

Follow-up questions:  1. How does the computational cost of fine-tuning the MLLM retriever with preference pairs scale with the size of the expert trajectory memory?  2.  Could the Trajectory Abstraction mechanism be further improved by incorporating reinforcement learning to dynamically select the most relevant milestones based on the current task and environment?  3.

The gap between sequence and graph planning capabilities emphasizes that current LLMs struggle with generating more complex, parallel workflows, even with strong language understanding.   Follow-up Questions:  1.  Could providing LLMs with explicit training data on graph structures, beyond simply relying on implicit learning from sequential data, improve graph workflow generation performance? 2.

| Rectified Diffusion: Straightness Is Not Your Need in Rectified Flow (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07303) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.07303))| Ling Yang, hsli-cuhk, Edify-Kd2024, DrinkingCoder, wangfuyun | a) The paper investigates the core factors contributing to the effectiveness of rectified flow for accelerating diffusion model generation and explores its generalization to broader diffusion model variants.  b) The authors propose Rectified Diffusion, which retrains a pre-trained diffusion model using pre-computed noise-sample pairs, eliminating the need for flow-matching and v-prediction used in rectified flow. They also introduce Rectified Diffusion (Phased), which enforces local first-order linearity of the ODE path within segmented time steps, and utilize consistency distillation for low-step generation enhancement.  c) Rectified Diffusion achieves a 1-step FID score of 27.26 on the COCO-2017 validation set compared to 47.91 for Rectified Flow, demonstrating faster training and superior performance.  d) AI practitioners can leverage Rectified Diffusion to simplify the training process and improve the performance of accelerated diffusion models without model conversion to flow-matching forms, potentially enabling faster and higher quality generation for various applications. The most impactful finding is that paired noise-sample retraining is the crucial element, not ODE path straightness, expanding the applicability of rectified diffusion to wider diffusion model types.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the performance of Rectified Diffusion scale with different model architectures and datasets beyond Stable Diffusion and COCO?  2. What are the practical considerations and limitations when implementing the phased approach for real-world applications with varying computational constraints?  3. How does the choice of consistency distillation technique impact the final performance, and are there alternative distillation methods that could further improve low-step generation quality?  |
| Intriguing Properties of Large Language and Vision Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04751) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.04751))| Ho-Jin Choi, yechan99, mkmiracle, kobiso, passing2961 | This research investigates the perceptual and cognitive properties of Large Language and Vision Models (LLVMs), particularly how they process and interpret visual information. The study evaluates LLaVA-series models on 10 benchmarks, including MMVP, MathVista, and AI2D, using methods such as permutation of visual patch tokens, occlusion of image regions, and use of synthetic images.  Results show that LLVMs exhibit permutation invariance with minimal performance drop (e.g., <1% average drop for LLaVA 1.5 across 10 benchmarks after shuffling visual patch tokens) and robustness to occlusion, even solving some math problems with limited visual input. This implies that LLVMs process images globally rather than relying heavily on localized pixel information. For AI practitioners, this suggests that optimization efforts should focus on enhancing global image understanding and cross-modal alignment rather than solely on pixel-level processing.  Here are some follow-up questions an AI practitioner might ask:  1.  Given the observed permutation invariance, could architectural modifications that explicitly encourage local feature attention improve performance on tasks requiring detailed visual understanding, such as MMVP or fine-grained image classification? 2.  How can the observed trade-off between complex cognitive reasoning abilities and basic visual recognition capabilities (catastrophic forgetting) be mitigated during the fine-tuning process of LLVMs? 3.  How can we design more complex and interactive evaluation benchmarks to better assess the performance and generalization capabilities of LLVMs in real-world scenarios that necessitate multi-turn interactions and personalized responses?  |
| Towards Self-Improvement of LLMs via MCTS: Leveraging Stepwise Knowledge with Curriculum Preference Learning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06508) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.06508))| Ye Tian, haitaominlp, Pluie1503, freesunshine0316, russwang | a) This research aims to improve the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by more effectively distilling behaviors learned through Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).  b) The proposed ALPHALLM-CPL framework uses stepwise trajectory pair extraction from MCTS and curriculum preference learning (CPL) to train LLMs.  CPL dynamically adjusts the training sequence of trajectory pairs, prioritizing those most critical for learning.  c) On the GSM8K benchmark, ALPHALLM-CPL improved the performance of LLaMA2-7B from 14.6 to 36.5, a 150% increase.  d) AI practitioners can leverage ALPHALLM-CPL to significantly enhance the mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs using MCTS without needing extensive external data or stronger models, offering a path toward more autonomous LLM improvement.  Follow-up questions:  1. What is the computational cost of generating the stepwise trajectory pairs and implementing the curriculum preference learning compared to existing MCTS distillation methods?  2. How does the performance of ALPHALLM-CPL vary with different values of the margin  'τ' and balance rate 'α' used in trajectory pair extraction and curriculum preference learning, respectively?  What guidelines are there for tuning these hyperparameters?  |
| Preserving Multi-Modal Capabilities of Pre-trained VLMs for Improving Vision-Linguistic Compositionality (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05210) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.05210))| Junmo Kim, In So Kweon, Dong-Jin Kim, Jae Won Cho, ytaek-oh | This research aimed to improve the compositional reasoning of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) while maintaining their performance on standard multi-modal tasks.  The researchers developed Fine-grained Selective Calibrated CLIP (FSC-CLIP), which incorporates local hard negative loss based on patch-token alignments and selective calibrated regularization to mitigate the negative impact of hard negative training. FSC-CLIP, when fine-tuned on a 100K subset of LAION-COCO, achieved a compositionality score of 53.5 and a zero-shot classification score of 55.9, nearly matching the pre-trained CLIP's zero-shot performance. This suggests that FSC-CLIP allows for significant improvements in compositional reasoning without sacrificing performance on other crucial VLM tasks, offering a more balanced and robust model for AI practitioners.  It is unclear if this method extends beyond fine-tuning to pre-training, or whether it is directly applicable to other similar architectures or models besides CLIP.  Follow-up questions:  1.  How does the computational cost of FSC-CLIP during training and inference compare to existing fine-tuning methods like DAC-LLM or NegCLIP, especially with larger datasets and models? 2. Could the authors elaborate on the limitations of using short captions, and provide concrete examples of the complex contextual nuances and longer-range dependencies in detailed descriptions that current VLMs struggle with?  What future research directions are suggested for addressing these challenges?  |
| SFTMix: Elevating Language Model Instruction Tuning with Mixup Recipe (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05248) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.05248))| Sanqiang Zhao, Marzyeh Ghassemi, wzhouad, szhang42, YuxinXiao | This paper investigates improving large language model (LLM) instruction-tuning performance without relying on curated datasets.  The authors propose SFTMix, which leverages training dynamics to split a dataset into confident and unconfident subsets and applies a Mixup-based regularization during instruction tuning.  Results on MT-Bench and AlpacaEval-2 show that SFTMix outperforms the next-token prediction (NTP) baseline, with Llama-3.1-8B achieving a 4.5825 overall score on MT-Bench with SFTMix versus 4.3625 with NTP.  This implies that AI practitioners can potentially improve LLM instruction-tuning performance and generalization on downstream tasks by incorporating the SFTMix recipe without requiring costly dataset curation.  The paper does not specify the precise algorithm for assigning data points to confident/unconfident splits based on the perplexity calculations.  Follow-up questions:  1.  What is the specific algorithm used to assign data points to the "confident" and "unconfident" subsets based on the calculated Conf(Vᵢ|Xᵢ) values?  Is it a simple threshold, or a more complex clustering approach? 2.  How does the computational cost of calculating the training dynamics and performing the Mixup regularization compare to the computational savings from using less curated data?  Is there a net benefit in terms of resource usage? 3.  How does SFTMix perform with very large LLMs and datasets where calculating perplexity over the entire training set for multiple checkpoints becomes significantly more expensive?  Are there strategies for efficient approximation or scaling in such scenarios?  |
| Progressive Autoregressive Video Diffusion Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08151) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.08151))| Hao Tan, Zhan Xu, smebliu, YicongHong, desaix | a) The research aims to extend the temporal capacity of video diffusion models, which are currently limited to short video generation due to computational constraints during training.  b) The authors propose progressive autoregressive video diffusion models, assigning progressively increasing noise levels to latent frames within the attention window during denoising, enabling autoregressive generation of extended video sequences.  This method involves finetuning existing video diffusion models on a modified noise schedule and applying a specific autoregressive sampling procedure.  c)  On a long video generation task (60 seconds, 1440 frames), their best performing model (PA-M) achieved an average dynamic degree score of 0.8, substantially outperforming other baselines while maintaining competitive scores on other metrics like aesthetic and imaging quality.  It is unclear how the number of training steps differed between PA-M and other models.  d) AI practitioners can leverage this progressive denoising technique to generate significantly longer, high-quality videos using existing video diffusion model architectures, potentially reducing the need for computationally expensive training of entirely new long-video models.  The paper implies this progressive denoising method can be applied to different video diffusion architectures, but only demonstrates it on transformer-based architectures.  Follow-up questions:  1.  Could the performance gains of progressive autoregressive denoising be further enhanced by exploring alternative noise scheduling strategies beyond the linear schedule used in this research?  2.  How does the computational cost of finetuning a pre-trained video diffusion model with progressive noise levels compare to the computational cost of training a new model specifically designed for long-video generation?  3. The paper mentions chunk-by-chunk processing as being crucial. How does chunk size impact long-video generation quality and computational cost, and is there an optimal chunk size for different model architectures?  |
| GLOV: Guided Large Language Models as Implicit Optimizers for Vision Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06154) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.06154))| aquila147, mdorkenw, paulgavrikov, sivand, kevinmzy | This research explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to optimize prompts for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), aiming to improve VLM performance on downstream vision tasks like image classification.  The key methodology, GLOV, involves a meta-prompting LLM with task descriptions and ranked in-context examples, coupled with embedding space guidance to steer prompt generation.  Results show GLOV improves zero-shot CLIP accuracy on ImageNet by up to 15.0% and LLaVa accuracy by up to 57.5%.  This implies AI practitioners can leverage LLMs to automatically discover highly effective prompts for VLMs, significantly boosting performance without gradient-based training or fine-tuning.  Follow-up questions:  1. What are the computational resource requirements (e.g., GPU memory, runtime) for running GLOV, especially with larger datasets and VLMs? 2. How sensitive is GLOV's performance to the choice of LLM and its hyperparameters (e.g., number of optimization steps, guidance scaling factor)? 3. How does the performance of GLOV-generated prompts compare to fine-tuning VLMs on downstream tasks in few-shot settings?  |
| Optima: Optimizing Effectiveness and Efficiency for LLM-Based Multi-Agent System (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08115) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.08115))| Cheng Yang, Chen Qian, Jiarui Yuan, zibuyu9, weizechen | a) The research aimed to develop a training framework for Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) that enhances communication efficiency and task effectiveness.  b) OPTIMA, the proposed framework, uses an iterative generate, rank, select, and train paradigm with a reward function balancing task performance, token efficiency, and communication readability, incorporating techniques like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).  c) OPTIMA achieved up to a 2.8x performance gain with less than 10% of the tokens compared to Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) on tasks requiring heavy information exchange.  d) OPTIMA enables more efficient use of inference compute, potentially leading to better inference-time scaling laws, which AI practitioners can leverage for performance gains without additional model training.  OPTIMA's demonstrated ability to significantly reduce token usage while improving performance is directly applicable to improving the computational efficiency of deployed LLM-based MAS.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does OPTIMA's MCTS-inspired DPO data generation compare to alternative data generation methods for multi-agent DPO in terms of computational cost and resulting data quality?  2.  Could the observed improvements in inference scaling laws be further amplified by combining OPTIMA with more advanced answer aggregation techniques like weighted voting?  3. What are the limitations of OPTIMA's current implementation, and what future research directions could address these limitations (e.g., scaling to larger models, more complex multi-agent scenarios)?  |
| Emergent properties with repeated examples (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07041) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.07041))| François Charton, Knykny | a) The research investigates the impact of training example repetition on transformer performance in mathematical tasks, challenging the prevailing assumption that maximizing distinct training examples is always optimal. b) The study uses algorithmically generated datasets for greatest common divisor (GCD), modular multiplication, and matrix eigenvalue calculation, controlling repetition frequency and employing two-set training (repeating a random subset more frequently). c) For GCD, with a training budget of 600 million examples and a data budget of 100 million, two-set training with a repeated subset of 50,000 examples (repeated 3000 times) achieved 69 correctly predicted GCDs, outperforming single-set training which achieved 27.  d)  AI practitioners should consider training set size (distinct examples) as a hyperparameter and explore the potential of two-set training, where repeating a small random subset more frequently can improve performance and learning speed.  The paper lacks information on the computational costs of two-set training compared to standard practices.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the computational cost of two-set training, including storage and processing overhead from increased repetition, compare to standard single-epoch training with a larger dataset?  2. How does two-set training perform in comparison to curriculum learning approaches using specifically curated example subsets for repetition?  3. What is the relationship between the optimal repetition frequency and dataset characteristics like size and task complexity in a two-set training paradigm?  |
| Scaling Up Your Kernels: Large Kernel Design in ConvNets towards Universal Representations (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08049) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.08049))| xyyue, DingXiaoH, Yiyuan | This paper investigates whether large-kernel ConvNets can offer universal modeling capabilities similar to Vision Transformers (ViTs) with reduced complexity.  The authors propose UniRepLKNet, a novel ConvNet architecture based on a set of design principles for large kernels, emphasizing depth-wise convolutions, identity shortcuts, and dilated small kernel re-parameterization.  UniRepLKNet achieves 88.0% ImageNet top-1 accuracy and demonstrates strong performance across modalities like audio (98.5% accuracy on Speech Commands V2), video, and time-series forecasting. This suggests that large-kernel ConvNets provide a viable, efficient alternative to transformers for diverse AI tasks.  Follow-up questions:  1.  The paper mentions modality-specific preprocessing to transform data into 3D embedding maps.  Could the authors elaborate on the specific preprocessing steps used for each modality beyond the brief descriptions provided?  This information would be crucial for replicating the results and applying the architecture to new modalities. 2.  What are the memory and computational requirements of UniRepLKNet compared to ViTs and other state-of-the-art models on downstream tasks beyond ImageNet classification?  More detailed comparisons would help assess the practical advantages of UniRepLKNet for resource-constrained applications. 3. How does the performance of UniRepLKNet change with varying kernel sizes in different stages, and what guidelines can be derived for selecting optimal kernel sizes based on specific task characteristics?  Deeper analysis of kernel size influence could lead to more fine-grained architectural optimization.  |

It also incorporates a camera pose refinement module that alternately optimizes 3D Gaussians and camera poses.  c)  On the NeRF-DS dataset, MotionGS achieves a mean PSNR of 24.54, outperforming the baseline method (Deformable 3DGS) which achieved 23.61.  d) AI practitioners can use MotionGS to reconstruct dynamic scenes from monocular video with improved quality and robustness compared to existing deformable 3DGS methods, especially in scenarios involving complex or rapid motion.  The CUDA-based implementation of the Gaussian flow and camera pose optimization allows for efficient training and rendering.   Follow-up questions:  1. Could the optical flow decoupling module be adapted or improved for scenes where segmentation masks for dynamic objects are not readily available or easily obtained?  2.  How does the computational cost of the motion flow extraction and camera pose refinement impact real-time rendering performance, and what are the potential optimization strategies to mitigate this?  3. How sensitive is MotionGS to the accuracy of the initial camera poses provided by COLMAP, and are there alternative initialization strategies that could further improve robustness in challenging scenarios?  |

| GLEE: A Unified Framework and Benchmark for Language-based Economic Environments (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05254) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.05254))| Roi Reichart, Samuel Joseph Amouyal, Omer Madmon, ireinman, EilamSha | a) This research aimed to create a standardized framework for evaluating large language model (LLM) agents in language-based economic games and comparing their behavior to humans.  b) The researchers developed GLEE, a framework parameterizing bargaining, negotiation, and persuasion games, controlling for game horizon, information structure, and communication form. They collected a dataset of LLM vs. LLM interactions (7.15M decisions in 954K games across four LLMs) and human vs. LLM interactions (3.4K games across 195 configurations, played on a custom-built interface). Regression models were used to predict metric values for uncollected configurations, enabling cross-model comparison.  c) Humans outperformed LLMs in bargaining as the proposer (Alice) but performed worse as the responder (Bob), while in negotiation, LLMs generally achieved positive self-gain compared to humans' negative average self-gain.  d) AI practitioners can use GLEE and its accompanying dataset to benchmark and compare LLM performance across various economic game scenarios, potentially leading to the development of more effective and human-like agents for applications requiring strategic decision-making in natural language. The paper highlights the sensitivity of average metric values to configuration distributions, suggesting practitioners consider specific application contexts when designing LLM agents for economic interactions.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the choice of LLM architecture (e.g., transformer size, decoder-only vs. encoder-decoder) affect agent performance within the GLEE framework, and are there specific architectures better suited for certain economic games?  2.  Can the regression models used to predict metrics be improved by incorporating more sophisticated techniques (e.g., neural networks) or features derived from the text of the LLM-generated messages?  3.  What specific prompt engineering strategies can be employed to mitigate the observed discrepancies between human and LLM performance in different roles within negotiation and bargaining games?  |
| Personalized Visual Instruction Tuning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07113) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.07113))| Jipeng Zhang, Tianyang Han, research4pan, Sterzhang, renjiepi | a) This research aims to enhance Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to conduct personalized conversations, addressing their current limitation in recognizing specific individuals within images and generating corresponding information.  b) The key methodology is Personalized Visual Instruction Tuning (PVIT), involving a data curation framework that synthesizes personalized training data using visual expert models, image generation models, and LLMs, and then fine-tunes the MLLM using this data.  Personalized wrapper tokens are also introduced to prevent ambiguity when multiple individuals are present.  c) On the P-Bench benchmark designed to evaluate personalized conversation abilities, PVIT-trained P-LLaVA achieves 96.69% average accuracy on answerable multiple-choice questions, significantly outperforming other SOTA MLLMs.  d) AI practitioners can use PVIT to fine-tune MLLMs for enhanced personalization, enabling development of applications like personalized visual assistants or domestic robots capable of recognizing family members.  The automatic data generation aspect of PVIT reduces the burden of manual data curation for personalized training.  Follow-up questions:  1.  Could the PVIT framework be adapted to personalize other aspects of MLLM responses beyond individual recognition, such as preferred conversational style or specific knowledge domains? 2.  How does the computational cost of fine-tuning with PVIT compare to other personalization methods that introduce new parameters or model heads? 3.  What are the limitations of the automatically generated personalized training data, and how can these be addressed to further improve the performance of personalized MLLMs?  |
| Towards World Simulator: Crafting Physical Commonsense-Based Benchmark for Video Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05363) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.05363))| kpzhang, hflqf88888, wqshao126, ljq940913, FanqingM | a) This research investigates the ability of text-to-video (T2V) models to generate videos adhering to basic physical laws, a key step towards building world simulators.  b) The authors introduce PhyGenBench, a benchmark with 160 prompts related to 27 physical laws, and PhyGenEval, a hierarchical evaluation framework utilizing vision-language models and large language models.  c)  Even the best-performing T2V model (Gen-3) achieved a low physical commonsense accuracy score of 0.51 on PhyGenBench.  d) This highlights a significant limitation of current T2V models in accurately representing physical world dynamics, requiring AI practitioners to prioritize incorporating physical commonsense into model training beyond simply improving general video quality metrics.  e) The paper mentions exploring scaling laws, prompt engineering, and video enhancement techniques as potential solutions but does not definitively quantify their impact on improving physical commonsense in generated videos.   Follow-up questions:  1. Could providing T2V models with access to physics simulators or synthetic datasets during training improve their performance on PhyGenBench? 2. What specific architectural changes in T2V models might be most effective in enhancing their understanding of dynamic physical phenomena? 3.  How can PhyGenEval be adapted or extended to evaluate more complex physical interactions and nuanced physical laws beyond those represented in the current PhyGenBench?  |
| Deciphering Cross-Modal Alignment in Large Vision-Language Models with Modality Integration Rate (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07167) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.07167))| Pan Zhang, Xiaoyi Dong, lindahua, yuhangzang, shikiw | a) This paper aims to develop a metric for evaluating the pre-training quality of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) without requiring computationally expensive supervised fine-tuning.  b) The researchers propose Modality Integration Rate (MIR), calculated by measuring the layer-wise Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) between vision and text token representations after text-centric normalization.  c) MIR correlates strongly with post-supervised fine-tuning benchmark performance; for example, when pre-training LLaVA-1.5 7B with varying amounts of data, MIR effectively identified performance saturation at 800K-1M samples, while loss and perplexity continued to decrease beyond this point.  d) AI practitioners can use MIR to optimize LVLM pre-training by efficiently identifying optimal data scales, detailedness, training strategies, and module designs without relying solely on costly downstream evaluation. This directly impacts model development efficiency.  e) The paper does not provide a precise definition of "text-centric normalization", though it mentions  l2-normalization and a scaling factor.   Follow-up questions:  1.  Could the authors provide more detail on the implementation of "text-centric normalization," including the outlier removal function and how the scaling factor *αk* is specifically computed for each layer *k*? 2. How computationally efficient is MIR to calculate compared to traditional metrics, and does its computational cost scale linearly with the number of samples used? 3. While MIR correlates with downstream performance, does minimizing MIR during pre-training *guarantee* optimal downstream performance, or are there other factors to consider?  |

Follow-up Questions:  1. The paper mentions progressively expanding the model gallery. What criteria are used for selecting new models to add, and how does this expansion affect the computational cost of training and inference?  2.  What are the specific architectural details of the composition-aware reward models, and how are the image and text features combined within them?  The paper mentions BLIP and cross-attention, but more detail would be beneficial for replication.  3.  How robust is IterComp to variations in the initial base diffusion model? Would similar improvements be observed if a different base model was used, and does the choice of initial model influence the optimal model gallery composition?  |

The authors pre-trained ARIA, a fine-grained MoE decoder with a lightweight visual encoder, from scratch using a 4-stage pipeline focused on language, multimodal understanding, long context, and instruction following, with 6.4T language and 400B multimodal tokens.  ARIA achieved 65.3% accuracy on the LongVideoBench (test set), outperforming Pixtral-12B and Llama3.2-11B.  This provides AI practitioners with an accessible and high-performing open-source model for multimodal applications, particularly those involving long sequences and diverse data types. The paper does not explicitly detail the specific architectures of competing models, or the hardware used in the various experiments.  Follow-up questions:  1.  Could the authors provide more details on the specific architecture of the visual encoder and how it handles different image resolutions and video input?  This would be helpful for understanding how the model processes and integrates visual information. 2.  The paper mentions a 4-stage training pipeline.  Could the authors provide more quantitative details on the data and compute resources allocated to each stage? This would clarify the resource requirements for replicating or adapting the training process. 3.  How does ARIA's performance compare to proprietary models on tasks that specifically test fine-grained multimodal reasoning capabilities, such as detailed image captioning or visual question answering with complex reasoning steps?  This is crucial for understanding the model's strengths and weaknesses in real-world scenarios.  |

Evaluation was performed on existing and newly created benchmarks, including a novel multimodal benchmark, MM-MT-Bench, designed for practical multi-turn scenarios.  c) Pixtral 12B outperforms all open-source models of similar size on the MM-MT-Bench benchmark, achieving a score of 6.05, and exhibits competitive performance compared to larger models on established multimodal and text-only benchmarks.  d) Pixtral 12B offers AI practitioners a powerful, open-source, multimodal model with strong performance on a range of tasks, potentially serving as a drop-in replacement for existing text-only or less capable multimodal deployments.  The introduction of MM-MT-Bench provides a new benchmark for evaluating practical multimodal use cases.    Follow-up questions:  1.  What are the specific architectural details of the Pixtral-ViT vision encoder, including the number of layers, attention heads, and hidden dimension? 2.

| Unveiling the Backbone-Optimizer Coupling Bias in Visual Representation Learning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06373) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.06373))| szli-0000, sunbaigui, SOTA-Owner, ZCLiu35, ZedongWangAI | This paper investigates the interplay between vision backbones and optimizers, questioning their assumed independent applicability.  Researchers benchmarked 20 backbones (CNNs, ViTs, etc.) against 20 optimizers (SGD, AdamW, etc.) on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and COCO, evaluating accuracy, hyperparameter robustness, and learned parameter patterns.  Results revealed a backbone-optimizer coupling bias (BOCB), where classical CNNs perform better with SGD families, while modern architectures like ViTs favor adaptive learning rate optimizers; for example, ConvNeXt-T achieved 86.19% top-1 accuracy with AdamW but only 33.26% with LARS on CIFAR-100. This implies that AI practitioners should carefully consider the backbone-optimizer pairing, as BOCB can significantly impact performance and generalization.  The paper mentions analyzing learned parameter patterns, but specifics of the analysis methods and quantitative results are unclear within the abstract and first page.  Follow-up questions:  1.  Could the authors elaborate on the specific metrics used to analyze learned parameter patterns (e.g., PL exponent alpha, entropy, L2-norm, PCA energy ratio) and provide quantitative results or visualizations showcasing these patterns for different backbone-optimizer combinations? 2.  How does the severity of BOCB vary across different downstream tasks and datasets beyond image classification (e.g., object detection, segmentation)?  Are there specific tasks or datasets where BOCB is more or less pronounced? 3.  The paper mentions "insights on more robust vision backbone design" - can the authors provide specific examples of design modifications or principles that could mitigate BOCB and improve overall robustness to optimizer choice?  |

The impactful finding is the substantial reduction in training compute, enabling faster iteration and experimentation with large video models.   Follow-up questions:  1.  What is the detailed architecture of the 3D VAE used for spatiotemporal compression, and how does its performance compare to other video compression techniques in terms of reconstruction quality and compression ratio?  2.  How does the proposed pyramidal flow matching method scale with increasing video length and resolution, and what are the practical limitations in terms of maximum video duration and resolution that can be achieved with reasonable computational resources?  3. Could the authors elaborate on the specific implementation details of the "corrective Gaussian noise" and its impact on the continuity of the generated video across different pyramid stages?  |
| MM-Ego: Towards Building Egocentric Multimodal LLMs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07177) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.07177))| HaoxuanYou, FrozzZen, edaxberger, haotiz, leoye | This research aims to build a multimodal foundation model for understanding egocentric videos.  The authors developed a "narration to egocentric QA" data engine to generate 7M QA samples from Ego4D narrations, a Memory Pointer Prompting mechanism within a multimodal LLM architecture, and a new benchmark called EgoMemoria containing 7,026 multiple-choice questions across 629 egocentric videos. MM-Ego, the resulting model, achieves a Mean Debiased Accuracy (MDA) of 61.27% on EgoMemoria, outperforming other models.  This provides AI practitioners with a new model and benchmark for developing and evaluating egocentric video understanding systems, advancing the field of egocentric AI.   Follow-up Questions:  1.  How does the Memory Pointer Prompting mechanism's computational cost scale with increasing video length compared to existing long-context transformer approaches? 2.  What specific types of egocentric video understanding tasks, beyond episodic memory, could benefit from the MM-Ego model and EgoMemoria benchmark, and how might the dataset and model need to be adapted? 3.  How robust is the "narration to egocentric QA" data engine to variations in narration quality and style, and what measures are taken to mitigate potential biases introduced during data generation?   |
| One Initialization to Rule them All: Fine-tuning via Explained Variance Adaptation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07170) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.07170))| Marc Peter Deisenroth, Benedikt Alkin, thomasschmied, sirluk, paischer101 | a) The paper investigates how to improve the initialization of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for fine-tuning foundation models to enhance convergence and downstream task performance.  b) Explained Variance Adaptation (EVA) initializes LoRA's new weights using a data-driven approach: performing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on minibatches of activation vectors from the downstream task data, sorting right-singular vectors by explained variance, and using the top-k components for initialization.  Ranks are re-distributed among weight matrices to maximize explained variance.  c) EVA combined with DORA achieved 73.5% accuracy on BoolQ, outperforming standard LoRA (67.2%) and other baselines on a suite of language generation tasks when fine-tuning Llama-2-7B.  d) AI practitioners can leverage EVA to potentially accelerate fine-tuning and improve the performance of foundation models on downstream tasks by using a more informed initialization strategy for LoRA, focusing compute resources on rank adaptation, rather than uniform rank distribution across layers.   Follow-up Questions:  1.  The paper mentions computational overhead for the initial SVD computation, but doesn't quantify it relative to the subsequent fine-tuning process.  What is the time and memory cost of the EVA initialization compared to the overall fine-tuning time and memory usage for various model sizes?  2.  How does the choice of the rank redistribution hyperparameter *p* affect the trade-off between performance and computational cost during initialization and fine-tuning, and are there any heuristics for choosing an appropriate *p* for a new dataset or task?  3.  The paper focuses on vision, language, and reinforcement learning tasks.  How well does EVA generalize to other modalities or model architectures beyond transformers?  |

The impactful finding is the iterative refinement with GRCA, which allows for the integration of global story context without the computational expense of methods like Consistent Self-Attention.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the linear weighting strategy for fusing text and image modalities in Story-Adapter impact the trade-off between text adherence and visual consistency across different story genres or artistic styles?  2. Could the GRCA module be adapted to other generative tasks beyond story visualization, such as video generation or 3D scene synthesis, and what modifications might be necessary for optimal performance?  3. What are the practical memory and latency considerations for deploying Story-Adapter for real-time or interactive story visualization applications?  |

Follow-up questions:  1.  How does the performance of SynPO compare to other preference optimization methods like DPO and KTO when used within the SynPO framework, and what are the trade-offs in terms of computational cost and alignment effectiveness? 2.

It also offers an alternative for scaling LLMs.  Follow-up Questions:  1. While Falcon Mamba 7B shows strong performance in few-shot learning, the paper briefly mentions limitations in in-context learning.  What specific experiments were conducted to evaluate in-context learning, and what were the quantitative results compared to transformers?  2. The paper highlights the advantage of constant memory usage during generation with Mamba architecture. Was the impact of sequence length during *training* also explored and if so what are the observed trade-offs on the resultant model's performance on downstream tasks?  3.

They then introduced Textual Temporal reasoning Transfer (T3), which synthesizes textual temporal reasoning tasks from image-text datasets and fine-tunes LongVA-7B on this data.  c) Results indicate that the LLM decoder is the primary bottleneck in video temporal reasoning, as visual encoders achieved high accuracy on probing tasks while LLMs struggled even with textual temporal questions.  T3 improved LongVA-7B's temporal understanding, leading to a 5.3 absolute accuracy improvement on the TempCompass benchmark.  d)  AI practitioners developing Video LLMs should focus on enhancing the temporal reasoning capabilities of the underlying LLM rather than solely focusing on visual feature encoding.  Textual temporal reasoning datasets synthesized from existing image-text data offer a scalable and efficient method for improving Video LLM performance in this area.    Follow-up questions:  1.  What specific architectural modifications or training strategies could further enhance the LLM's ability to handle temporal information beyond the T3 approach? 2.  How does the performance of T3 scale with larger LLMs and more complex temporal reasoning tasks beyond those explored in the paper? 3.

TRACE processes visual frames, timestamps, salient scores, and text as separate tasks with dedicated encoders and decoding heads, sequencing these tasks according to the causal framework.  c) TRACE demonstrated superior zero-shot performance on various VTG tasks, improving CIDEr score by 3.1% and F1 score by 4.9% on YouCook2 compared to existing video LLMs.  d) For AI practitioners, TRACE offers a more effective architecture for developing video LLMs for VTG tasks, potentially enabling improvements in downstream applications like moment retrieval, dense video captioning, and highlight detection. The improved zero-shot performance reduces the reliance on resource-intensive fine-tuning for numerous tasks.   Follow-up questions:  1.

| Data Selection via Optimal Control for Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07064) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.07064))| Li Dong, thegenerality, Rsy24, howang, t1101675 | a) The research investigates selecting high-quality pre-training data from large corpora to improve language model (LM) performance and training efficiency.  b) The authors formulate data selection as an Optimal Control problem, leveraging Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP) to derive necessary conditions for optimal data selection and develop a framework called PMP-based Data Selection (PDS). PDS assigns quality scores to instances based on their impact on downstream tasks using a proxy dataset and trains a data scorer to predict these scores for the entire corpus.  c) Experiments show that pre-training a 1.7B parameter LM on a PDS-selected corpus achieves a 2.0x speedup compared to conventional pre-training on a uniformly sampled corpus.  d) PDS offers a principled method for data selection that can significantly accelerate LM training and improve downstream task performance, mitigating the increasing computational demands of pre-training large language models.   Follow-up Questions:  1. How does the performance of PDS compare to online data selection methods in terms of both computational cost and downstream task performance for models of various scales?  2.  What are the limitations of using a proxy dataset and data scorer, and how can these limitations be addressed to further improve the quality of selected data, especially for domain-specific applications?  3.  How robust is PDS to the choice of downstream task used for calculating the data quality scores, and how can this choice be optimized for specific downstream applications or when multiple downstream tasks are of interest?  |

Follow-up questions:  1.

How robust is ViBiDSampler to variations in the temporal distance between keyframes?  Does performance degrade significantly with larger gaps, and are there strategies within the bidirectional sampling framework to mitigate this?  3.  What are the limitations of using CLIP image embeddings as conditioning, and could alternative or complementary conditioning methods further improve the coherence and fidelity of the interpolated frames, particularly for videos containing complex semantic content?  |
| Response Tuning: Aligning Large Language Models without Instruction (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02465) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.02465))| Hyounghun Kim, seokhyun | a) This research investigates whether establishing a response space alone, without instruction-response mappings, can align pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for instruction following and safety.  b) The authors propose Response Tuning (RT), which omits the instruction-conditioning step in conventional instruction tuning and trains LLMs solely on responses.  They compare RT models to instruction-tuned models on various benchmarks.  c) RT models achieved comparable performance to instruction-tuned counterparts on several evaluations, achieving a 91% acceptability rating for Llama-3.1-8B trained with Alpaca responses.  d)  The study suggests that instruction-following capabilities may be largely acquired during pre-training and that establishing an appropriate response space alone can effectively surface these capabilities, simplifying alignment procedures for AI practitioners.  e)  The paper claims that the structural attributes of training responses impact user preference, but it's not fully clear how these attributes are quantitatively measured or controlled, despite mentioning the use of a refinement prompt with a stronger LLM.  Follow-up questions:  1.  Can the authors provide more details on the refinement prompt used to control structural attributes, including specific examples and how effectiveness was measured beyond GPT-4 pairwise comparisons? 2. How does the performance of RT scale with significantly larger models and datasets, and are there any observed limitations in terms of complexity or generalization of instructions? 3.

| ING-VP: MLLMs cannot Play Easy Vision-based Games Yet (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06555) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.06555))| Haoran Zhang, zhangysk, CheeryLJH, EZ-hwh, Rosiness | This research investigates the spatial imagination and multi-step reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision-based planning.  The authors introduce ING-VP, a benchmark comprising six games with varying levels, evaluated across six inference settings (image/text input, single/multi-step reasoning, with/without history).  Evaluation of 15 MLLMs showed even the top-performing model, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, achieved an average accuracy of only 3.37%.  This suggests current MLLMs have significant limitations in spatial reasoning and planning, particularly in accurately processing the relative positions of visual elements.  AI practitioners should consider these perceptual limitations and lack of robust planning capabilities when developing or applying MLLMs for tasks requiring spatial understanding and interaction.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does the performance of MLLMs in ING-VP compare to specifically designed spatial reasoning models that are not LLMs? 2. What specific architectural changes or training strategies could be explored to improve MLLMs' performance on tasks requiring precise location understanding within images? 3.

The high consistency score suggests this approach is effective in maintaining continuity across sessions with different partners.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does EMMA's retrieval module specifically prioritize relevant memories from previous sessions, given that it has access to all past interactions?  More details on the retrieval module's architecture and training process would be beneficial.  2.  What are the limitations of using GPT-3.5 for dialogue generation after using GPT-4 for scenario generation, and how might this impact the overall quality and consistency of the MISC dataset?  3.  Could the authors provide further details on the computational resources required to train EMMA, particularly the dialogue and retrieval modules? This information would be crucial for practitioners considering replicating or adapting the model.  |
| Retrieval-Augmented Decision Transformer: External Memory for In-context RL (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07071) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.07071))| Markus Hofmarcher, razp, vihangp, paischer101, thomasschmied | a) The research aimed to improve in-context reinforcement learning (ICL) in environments with long episodes and sparse rewards, which pose challenges for existing ICL methods that rely on full episode contexts.  b) The authors introduced Retrieval-Augmented Decision Transformer (RA-DT), which integrates an external memory mechanism with a Decision Transformer (DT).  RA-DT retrieves relevant sub-trajectories from the memory using a pre-trained embedding model and incorporates them into the DT via cross-attention.  c) RA-DT outperformed baseline ICL methods on grid-world environments, achieving near-optimal performance on Dark-Room 10x10 while using a context length of 50 transitions compared to baselines using a context length of 2400. While RA-DT showed improved average performance on more complex environments like Meta-World, DMControl and Procgen,  no in-context improvement was observed on hold-out tasks in these environments.  d) AI practitioners can leverage RA-DT to potentially reduce the computational cost and improve the effectiveness of ICL in certain RL environments, particularly those with long episodes that are computationally prohibitive for traditional ICL methods. The lack of ICL improvement on hold-out tasks for more complex environments suggests that further research is needed to improve retrieval techniques or conditioning strategies, highlighting a current limitation of offline, next-action prediction based ICL methods.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the performance of RA-DT vary with the size and diversity of the external memory, and what strategies can be used to optimize memory construction for specific domains?  2.  What modifications to the retrieval mechanism or the DT architecture could enable more effective meta-learning in complex environments, leading to stronger ICL performance on hold-out tasks?  3.  Could incorporating online learning or value function estimation into the RA-DT framework address the limitations observed in next-action prediction ICL and improve performance in complex, fully-observable environments?  |

A control policy was trained using reinforcement learning with imitation and goal-based rewards, leveraging diffusion-generated motions and music-based motion retrieval from the dataset.  c) The trained policy, evaluated on 14 unseen musical pieces, achieved an average F1-score of over 0.8, significantly outperforming diffusion-generated motions alone.  d) AI practitioners can utilize the FürElise dataset and the proposed pipeline combining diffusion models, motion retrieval, and reinforcement learning to synthesize realistic and dexterous hand motions for complex tasks, particularly in domains requiring precise physical interaction, such as character animation and robotics.   Follow-up Questions:  1. How does the proposed method address the limitations of diffusion models in generating physically plausible motions, specifically regarding the penetration and floating artifacts often observed in hand-object interactions?  What specific techniques are employed in the inverse kinematics refinement stage to address artifacts and ensure synchronized hand motion with MIDI key press events?  2.

The method utilizes a lifelong learning agent with three modules: attack generation and exploration, strategy library construction, and jailbreak strategy retrieval.  AutoDAN-Turbo achieved an 88.5% attack success rate on GPT-4-1106-turbo, a 74.3% improvement over the runner-up on the HarmBench dataset.  This implies that AutoDAN-Turbo can effectively bypass the safety alignment of even highly robust LLMs.  Follow-up questions:  1.

They also introduced multi-agent pipelines to improve situational safety reasoning.  c) Current MLLMs struggle with this task; the highest-performing model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, achieved only 62.2% average accuracy.  d) AI practitioners developing multimodal assistants should prioritize improving situational safety awareness in MLLMs, as current models exhibit significant limitations in integrating visual context for safe responses, especially in embodied scenarios.  This highlights a critical area for further research and development to prevent unsafe actions or advice in real-world applications.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does the performance of multi-agent pipelines vary across different MLLM architectures and sizes, and what architectural modifications could further enhance their effectiveness in situational safety assessment?  2.

A preprocessing step pre-calculates the computationally expensive motion guidance term.  c) T2V-Turbo-v2 achieved a state-of-the-art Total Score of 85.13 on VBench, surpassing proprietary systems like Gen-3 and Kling.  d) The research demonstrates the critical importance of dataset selection and RM diversity for effective T2V model post-training, offering AI practitioners valuable insights into improving video generation quality and text alignment.  The preprocessing approach to incorporating motion guidance presents a practical solution for managing computational cost.  Follow-up questions:  1.

The significant improvement in user-perceived video quality highlights the potential for a better user experience in T2V applications.   Follow-up questions:  1.

| Diversity-Rewarded CFG Distillation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06084) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.06084))| alexrame, Sper42, bachem, ferretj, aagostinelli86 | This research aims to improve the quality-diversity trade-off in generative models, specifically for text-to-music generation.  The authors introduce a novel finetuning strategy called diversity-rewarded CFG distillation, combining Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) distillation with reinforcement learning using a diversity reward based on embedding similarity.  Results on MusicLM show that model merging via linear interpolation of weights from a quality-focused model (β=0) and a diversity-focused model (β=15) creates a Pareto front outperforming individual models and baselines. Human evaluation confirms that the merged model (LERP(0,15)) exhibits higher diversity than CFG-augmented base model while maintaining comparable quality.  This implies that AI practitioners can leverage this technique to control the quality-diversity balance at deployment time without CFG's inference overhead by interpolating pre-trained model weights.  Follow-up questions:  1.  The paper mentions potential "reward hacking" with the diversity metric; could the authors elaborate on specific instances observed and suggest mitigation strategies beyond those mentioned (e.g., human/AI feedback embedding)? 2.  How does the computational cost of training the embedding model (E) compare to the cost of finetuning the generative model, and how does the embedding model's architecture and training impact the overall performance and efficiency of the proposed method? 3.

A simple fusion technique then merges the diffused images into a final texture map.  c) Ablation studies demonstrate the importance of pixel-wise correspondence attention and occlusion awareness for multi-view consistency, with the removal of correspondence attention noticeably worsening fusion fitting loss.  No specific quantitative improvement compared to baseline methods is provided for overall texture quality or realism.  d)  AI practitioners working with 3D models can leverage this method to generate PBR texture maps directly from text prompts and meshes, potentially bypassing traditional, more laborious texturing workflows.  However, the paper does not offer comparisons against other multi-view text-to-texture methods in terms of realism or efficiency.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the computational cost of this multi-view Collaborative Control approach compare to alternative multi-view texture generation methods, such as those using SDS or iterative inpainting?  2. What is the quantitative impact of the multi-view approach on metrics such as texture resolution, realism, and consistency compared to the original single-view Collaborative Control method or other state-of-the-art methods?  How do these metrics relate to visual quality as perceived by humans?  3.  The paper mentions challenges with unobserved areas during fusion.  What specific strategies for addressing these unobserved areas are being considered for future work, and how might these impact performance and texture quality?  |

The impactful finding is that data quality and diversity appear more crucial than model size for emotion classification in MM-LLMs.   Follow-up Questions:  1.

| Holistic Unlearning Benchmark: A Multi-Faceted Evaluation for Text-to-Image Diffusion Model Unlearning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05664) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.05664))| Dongwoo Kim, Sangdon Park, Minjong, hi-sammy | a) This research aims to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and side effects of text-to-image diffusion model unlearning methods.  b) The authors develop a benchmark called HUB, evaluating six unlearning methods (ESD, UCE, AC, SA, SalUn, Receler) across five aspects: effectiveness on target concepts, image faithfulness, prompt compliance, robustness to side effects, and consistency in downstream tasks.  c) No single method performed optimally across all evaluation aspects; for example, while Receler and SalUn showed robustness in removing the target concept under diverse prompts, they also exhibited a decrease in generated image quality. SalUn generated images with the lowest FID score of  21.4 compared to the original model's score of 20.8.  d) AI practitioners should consider the trade-offs between effectiveness, image quality, and potential side effects (e.g. over-erasing) when selecting an unlearning method for a specific application. The benchmark provides a tool for making informed decisions about which unlearning method is most suitable, based on specific project requirements.  e) The paper briefly states the reasoning behind the choice of the four concepts as "covering diverse and exhaustive scenarios", however more explanation as to why these particular scenarios are "exhaustive" would be helpful.  Follow-up questions:  1.  Given the over-erasing effect observed with some methods, what strategies can be explored to mitigate the unintended removal of related concepts while still effectively suppressing the target concept?  2.  How does the computational cost of each unlearning method compare, and how might this influence method selection in resource-constrained settings?  3. The paper analyzes the over-erasing effect using prompts of closely-related concepts, but doesn't explore how it influences the generation of loosely-related or even unrelated concepts which may potentially share some latent feature with the target concept. How does over-erasing affect the overall generative ability of the unlearned models?  |
| Hallucinating AI Hijacking Attack: Large Language Models and Malicious Code Recommenders (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06462) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.06462))| fgmckee, dnoever | a) The research investigates the risk of large language models (LLMs) recommending malicious code within software supply chains, particularly due to context-shifting within programming scenarios.  b) The study empirically tested several prominent foundational LLMs by providing prompts related to code generation, then examining the responses for recommendations of compromised API endpoints, RSS feeds, GitHub repositories, and npm packages.  c) The research demonstrates that LLMs, despite safety guardrails, can be manipulated into suggesting malicious code by framing risky suggestions within seemingly benign programming challenges; one specific finding is that GPT-40, while refusing to design a fake login page directly, generated code mimicking the PayPal website when framed as an HTML programming problem.  d) The main implication for AI practitioners is the need to develop stronger context-aware safeguards within LLMs and to critically evaluate AI-generated code recommendations, as the current vulnerability to context-shifting exposes security risks for software supply chains.   Follow-up questions:  1.  What specific mitigation techniques could be implemented to prevent context-shifting attacks, such as enhanced input sanitization or context-aware filtering of LLM outputs?  2.  How can code-review processes be augmented to effectively detect potentially malicious code introduced through LLM hallucinations or compromised recommendations?  3.  Could this type of vulnerability be utilized for "red teaming" exercises to proactively identify and address potential security weaknesses in LLMs before they are exploited by malicious actors?  |
| Seeker: Enhancing Exception Handling in Code with LLM-based Multi-Agent Approach (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06949) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.06949))| Minlie Huang, Yuan Yuan, Yuxuan Chen, XUANMINGZHANG | This research explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can improve the standardization, interpretability, and generalizability of exception handling in code.  The researchers developed Seeker, a multi-agent framework employing five agents (Planner, Detector, Predator, Ranker, and Handler) that integrate external exception documentation (CEE) with Deep Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Deep-RAG). Compared to baseline methods, Seeker achieved a 92% Code Review Score (CRS), indicating that 92% of generated exception handling implementations were deemed "good" by a GPT-40 evaluator.  This suggests that incorporating domain-specific knowledge and structured handling strategies into LLMs can significantly enhance the robustness of generated code, particularly in exception handling.  Follow-up questions:  1.  How does Seeker's performance vary across different programming languages, given the language-specific nature of exception handling mechanisms? 2.  What are the computational resource requirements and scalability limitations of Seeker when applied to very large codebases?  3.  Could the multi-agent architecture and Deep-RAG approach be generalized to other code reliability issues beyond exception handling, such as memory leaks or security vulnerabilities?  |
| Do great minds think alike? Investigating Human-AI Complementarity in Question Answering with CAIMIRA (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06524) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.06524))| Jordan Boyd-Graber, Hal Daumé III, zhoutianyi, mgor | This research investigates the differences in question-answering abilities between humans and AI systems. The study uses CAIMIRA, a novel framework based on Item Response Theory (IRT), to analyze over 300,000 responses from ~70 AI systems and 155 humans on QuizBowl questions.  Results show that humans outperform AI on knowledge-grounded abductive and conceptual reasoning, while LLMs like GPT-4-TURBO and LLAMA-3-70B excel at targeted information retrieval and fact-based reasoning. On questions requiring abductive recall (defined in the paper), human performance significantly exceeded GPT-4-TURBO's, highlighting humans' superior ability to connect abstract clues to specific entities.  AI practitioners should focus on developing QA systems that address the current weaknesses of LLMs in higher-order reasoning and nuanced linguistic interpretation, particularly in tasks with less direct information mapping.   Follow-up questions:  1.  How does CAIMIRA handle the potential bias introduced by using QuizBowl data, which might favor certain knowledge domains or reasoning skills? 2.  Could the study's findings be replicated with other question-answering datasets beyond QuizBowl, and if so, would we expect similar patterns of human-AI complementarity? 3.  What specific architectural or training modifications to LLMs could be investigated to improve performance on questions requiring abductive recall, based on the insights gained from human responses?  |
| MLE-bench: Evaluating Machine Learning Agents on Machine Learning Engineering (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07095) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.07095))| lilianweng, tejalp, thesofakillers, evanmays, nch0w | a) This research aims to evaluate the ability of AI agents to perform real-world machine learning engineering (MLE) tasks.  b) Researchers created MLE-bench, a benchmark of 75 diverse Kaggle competitions, and evaluated several frontier language models using open-source agent scaffolds, comparing agent performance against human leaderboards.  c) The best-performing setup, OpenAI's ol-preview model with AIDE scaffolding, achieved at least the level of a Kaggle bronze medal in 16.9% of competitions (pass@1), increasing to 34.1% with 8 attempts (pass@8).  d) AI practitioners should note that while current leading language models can achieve meaningful scores on MLE tasks with appropriate scaffolding, they still struggle with aspects like debugging and recovering from errors, particularly in more complex competitions. The significant improvement observed with increased attempts (pass@k) suggests further research on agent iteration and refinement strategies could be beneficial.  e) The paper does not clarify whether all 75 competitions used are medal-granting on Kaggle or whether some were adapted by the researchers.   Follow-up questions:  1. What specific modifications were made to the AIDE, MLAB, and OpenHands scaffolds to improve their performance on MLE-bench, and what was the rationale behind these modifications?  2.  How do the types and complexities of the MLE tasks included in the benchmark compare to typical real-world ML engineering work beyond Kaggle competitions?  3.  What are the computational costs (e.g., GPU hours, tokens) associated with running the benchmark, and what are the practical implications of this for researchers with limited resources?  |
| Does Spatial Cognition Emerge in Frontier Models? (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06468) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.06468))| vkoltun, philkra, erikwijmans, sramakrishnan | a) The research investigates whether spatial cognition emerges in contemporary frontier models, including large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (VLMs).  b) A new benchmark called SPACE was created, evaluating large-scale mapping, small-scale object reasoning, and cognitive infrastructure like spatial attention and memory, using text and image-based tasks derived from cognitive science literature.  c) Frontier models performed near chance level on key large-scale tasks, like those involving egocentric views;  however, on the small-scale selective attention task, some models like GPT-40 achieved over 95% accuracy.  d)  AI practitioners should consider the limitations of current frontier models in spatial cognition, particularly when applied to embodied AI or tasks requiring robust spatial understanding.  The discrepancy between high performance on some small-scale tasks and near-chance performance on large-scale, embodied tasks suggests uneven development of spatial reasoning abilities.  e) The paper does not provide detailed implementation specifics for the text array encoding for textual presentations of small-scale tasks, other than to mention they encode spatial information with 2D character arrays.  Follow-up questions:  1. What specific architectural changes could be explored to improve frontier model performance on large-scale, egocentric spatial tasks, given the current limitations?  2. How does the performance of models on SPACE correlate with performance on other established reasoning benchmarks, and what does this reveal about the relationship between spatial cognition and other cognitive abilities in these models?  3. Can the textual encodings of spatial information used in SPACE be open-sourced to facilitate further research and development of improved spatial reasoning capabilities in LLMs?  |

| LongGenBench: Long-context Generation Benchmark (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04199) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.04199))| Peijie Dong, wenxinsiju, xuminghui, Dominic789654 | This research addresses the lack of benchmarks for evaluating long-context *generation* capabilities of LLMs, focusing on consistency in logical flow.  The authors introduce a synthetic benchmark, LongGenBench, which redesigns input formats from existing benchmarks (MMLU, GSM8K, CSQA) to necessitate cohesive, multi-answer responses, thus evaluating generation in addition to retrieval skills.  Results show that both API-accessed and open-source models exhibit performance degradation in these long-context generation scenarios, ranging from 1.2% to 47.1%. The Gemini-1.5-Flash model showed the least degradation (1.2% on GSM8K) among API-accessed models. This research implies that AI practitioners should consider model limitations in long-context generation and prioritize models exhibiting greater resilience in such tasks.  Here are some follow-up questions an AI practitioner might ask:  1. How does the performance degradation observed in LongGenBench correlate with different long-context techniques, such as efficient attention mechanisms or state-space models? 2. What are the specific architectural differences between Gemini-1.5-Flash and other API-accessed models that contribute to its superior performance in long-context generation as measured by LongGenBench? 3.  Could fine-tuning strategies specifically targeting long-context generation consistency mitigate the performance degradation observed across different model architectures?  |
| $\textbf{Only-IF}$:Revealing the Decisive Effect of Instruction Diversity on Generalization (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04717) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.04717))| Francois Charton, Justin Wang, shizhuo2 | a) This research investigated the impact of instruction diversity on the generalization ability of large language models (LLMs) for instruction following.  b) Controlled experiments using symbolic string rewriting tasks inspired by the Turing-complete Markov algorithm, along with real-world code generation and general reasoning tasks, were conducted.  c)  Models trained on fewer than 300 unique string rewriting instructions consistently failed to generalize, while models trained on over 1000 distinct instructions generalized effectively. In code generation,  a model fine-tuned with 20,000 diverse instructions (OSS-Instruct, Alpaca, CoT) outperformed models trained on 75,000 code-specific instructions on the DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B-Base model.  d) AI practitioners should prioritize diversifying instruction data across different semantic domains rather than simply increasing the volume of data from a specific domain when fine-tuning LLMs for improved generalization.  The impactful finding that a smaller, diverse dataset can outperform a larger, domain-specific dataset highlights the critical role of strategic data diversification in LLM development.    Follow-up questions:  1.  How does the proposed methodology for evaluating instruction following, using symbolic string rewriting, translate to more complex real-world tasks beyond code generation, such as those involving multi-modal inputs or outputs?  2. While the research demonstrates the benefits of cross-domain diversification, it also mentions a trade-off between generalization and specialization. What specific metrics or methods can be used to determine the optimal balance between diverse and specialized instructions in a dataset for a given task and LLM architecture?   3.  Could the findings related to the number of unique instructions required for generalization (e.g., >1000 for the string rewriting task) be further analyzed to determine how this threshold scales with the complexity of the target tasks and the size of the LLM?  |
| RevisEval: Improving LLM-as-a-Judge via Response-Adapted References (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05193) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.05193))| lifengshang, YuxinJiang, Tiezheng, yufeiwang201217a, DonJoey | a) This research explores whether generating response-adapted references using LLMs can improve the reliability of LLM-based evaluation of text generation, especially in open-ended tasks.  b)  REVISEVAL, the proposed method, revises the model-generated response using the task instruction and evaluation rubric to create a response-adapted reference, which then guides subsequent evaluation by LLM-as-a-Judge or classic text metrics.  c) REVISEVAL improved the accuracy of Llama 3.1-8B as a judge on the LLMBar benchmark by approximately 6% compared to reference-free evaluation, highlighting its ability to mitigate biases like verbosity.  d)  AI practitioners can use REVISEVAL to improve the accuracy and reduce bias in automated evaluation of open-ended text generation tasks, potentially reducing the need for expensive and time-consuming human evaluation.  The paper suggests that leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs for revision, rather than just discrimination, can lead to more effective automated evaluation, especially with weaker LLMs.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the performance of REVISEVAL with different reviser LLMs (other than GPT-4 and Llama 3.1-8B) compare across various NLG and instruction-following tasks?  2. What are the computational costs of using REVISEVAL compared to other evaluation methods, and how can these costs be optimized for practical applications?  3. Could the revision process in REVISEVAL be further improved by incorporating techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to directly optimize the quality of the generated references?  |
| A Spark of Vision-Language Intelligence: 2-Dimensional Autoregressive Transformer for Efficient Finegrained Image Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01912) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.01912))| Sinan Tan, Jinze, JustinLin610, ZefanCai, leonardPKU | a) The research aims to address the information loss and computational limitations of vector-quantization (VQ) in autoregressive (AR) image generation.  b)  A novel architecture, the 2-Dimensional Autoregression (DnD) Transformer, is introduced, which predicts multiple codes for an image by incorporating a depth dimension in addition to spatial dimensions, thereby increasing the Information Compression Ratio.  c) On ImageNet256×256, DnD-Transformer achieves a Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) of 1.54 and an Inception Score (IS) improvement of 82.6 over the baseline LlamaGen XXL model with the same parameter count (1.4B) and using classifier-free guidance scale (cfg) of 2.  d) AI practitioners can use DnD-Transformer to generate higher-quality images, particularly those containing fine-grained detail and rich text, more efficiently than previous AR models relying solely on 1D autoregression.  The emergent vision-language capabilities also open possibilities for text-rich image generation in an unconditional setting.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the performance of DnD-Transformer scale with different codebook sizes (N) and downscaling factors (f), and what is the trade-off between image quality and computational cost in these scenarios?  2. What are the specific implementation details for integrating DnD-Transformer with existing LLMs for end-to-end training, and what are the observed benefits and challenges in such a setup?  3. How robust is the "spark" of vision-language intelligence observed in DnD-Transformer, and can this capability be explicitly controlled or directed for specific text-image generation tasks, rather than relying solely on emergent behavior?  |
| ControlAR: Controllable Image Generation with Autoregressive Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02705) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.02705))| Haocheng Shen, Peize Sun, Shoufa Chen, Tianheng Cheng, Zongming Li | a) The paper investigates controllable image generation using autoregressive (AR) models, aiming to achieve similar control as diffusion models like ControlNet. b) ControlAR encodes spatial control images (e.g., edges, depth maps) into tokens using a Vision Transformer (ViT) and incorporates these tokens into the AR image generation process via conditional decoding, where the next image token prediction is conditioned on both previous image tokens and the current control token. c) ControlAR achieves an FID of 10.53 on lineart edge control with the MultiGen-20M dataset, outperforming ControlNet++. d)  This work offers AI practitioners a more memory-efficient alternative to diffusion models for controllable image generation, allowing for arbitrary resolution outputs with competitive quality and controllability. The introduction of conditional decoding, more efficient than prefilling, is particularly relevant for developing and deploying large AR models for image generation tasks.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the performance of different ViT architectures and pretraining schemes for the control encoder affect the final image generation quality and controllability across diverse datasets and control types? 2.  What are the computational and memory trade-offs of using ControlAR with larger AR models like LlamaGen-L compared to smaller models like LlamaGen-B for different resolution outputs, and how does this impact practical deployment scenarios? 3. What strategies can be explored to extend ControlAR to handle multiple simultaneous control inputs, and how can the control fusion mechanism be optimized for more complex multi-control scenarios?  |
| MA-RLHF: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with Macro Actions (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02743) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.02743))| Yu Sun, Shuohuan Wang, Huang Fang, Haoran Sun, Yekun Chai | This paper addresses the inefficiency of token-level Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in Large Language Models (LLMs) due to the credit assignment problem.  The authors propose MA-RLHF, which incorporates macro actions (sequences of tokens) into the RLHF framework using a modified Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm called MA-PPO.  Experiments on text summarization using the TL;DR dataset show that MA-RLHF achieves parity with standard RLHF 1.7x to 2x faster and ultimately improves reward model scores by up to 30%. This implies that utilizing MA-RLHF can significantly improve training efficiency and performance of LLMs aligned with human preferences, allowing practitioners to train more effectively and produce higher-quality models.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does the choice of macro action termination strategy (n-gram, parsing-based, etc.) affect the performance and training efficiency of MA-RLHF on different downstream tasks?  2.  Are there specific types of tasks or datasets where the benefits of MA-RLHF are most pronounced, and are there any where it performs worse than standard RLHF?  3. What are the computational and memory implications of implementing MA-RLHF compared to standard RLHF, especially for large-scale models and datasets?  |
| Grounded-VideoLLM: Sharpening Fine-grained Temporal Grounding in Video Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03290) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.03290))| Yufan Zhou, Shizhe Diao, Yu Cheng, Zhiyang Xu, WHB139426 | a) This research addresses the challenge of fine-grained temporal grounding in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs), aiming to improve their ability to perceive and reason over specific video moments.  b) The authors introduce Grounded-VideoLLM, featuring a two-stream architecture (spatial and temporal) for encoding video segments and incorporating discrete temporal tokens into the LLM's vocabulary for timestamp representation. A three-stage training strategy progresses from video-caption alignment to temporal token alignment and finally multi-task instruction tuning, supplemented by a curated grounded VideoQA dataset.  c) On the NEXT-GQA dataset, Grounded-VideoLLM achieves an Acc@GQA score of 26.7%, a 2.4% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.  d) AI practitioners can leverage Grounded-VideoLLM to develop more accurate and robust video understanding applications, specifically for tasks requiring fine-grained temporal reasoning such as video question answering and dense video captioning.   Follow-up questions:  1.  What is the computational cost of the two-stream encoding approach, and how does it scale with video length and resolution? 2.  How does the choice of the video encoder (InternVideo2 in this case) impact the overall performance of Grounded-VideoLLM, and are there alternative video encoders that could be more efficient or effective? 3. Could you elaborate on the automatic annotation pipeline used to create the grounded VideoQA dataset, including details about prompt engineering and quality control measures to ensure data reliability?  |
| Hyper-multi-step: The Truth Behind Difficult Long-context Tasks (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04422) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.04422))| yuyijiong | This research investigates why long-context language models (LCLMs) struggle with complex tasks despite large context windows.  The study uses synthetic key-value and student resume retrieval datasets to evaluate LCLM performance on multi-matching retrieval (retrieving multiple items simultaneously) and logic-based retrieval (retrieval requiring logical judgment).  Results show accuracy decreases significantly for multi-matching retrieval as the number of matches increases, with some models approaching 0% accuracy with 5 or more matches in the Student Resume Retrieval task. The paper proposes that these tasks are "hyper-multi-step," requiring numerous independent steps exceeding LCLM simultaneous processing capacity.  This implies that simply increasing context window size may not improve LCLM performance on such tasks.   Follow-up questions:  1. What specific architectural limitations within current LCLMs prevent efficient handling of hyper-multi-step problems?  2. Beyond prompting LCLMs to write and execute programs, what alternative approaches might enable LCLMs to handle hyper-multi-step tasks more effectively?  3. How could the insights on the limitations of vector retrieval for logic-based tasks inform the development of more robust retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems?  |
| EBES: Easy Benchmarking for Event Sequences (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03399) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.03399))| Evgeny Burnaev, Viktor Moskvoretskii, Igor Udovichenko, Dmitry Osin, dalime | a) The paper introduces EBES, a benchmark for evaluating machine learning models on event sequences (EvS), aiming to standardize evaluation and facilitate comparison of model performance on this type of data.  b) EBES uses a standardized evaluation protocol with Monte Carlo cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization (HPO), incorporating diverse real-world and synthetic datasets and multiple established and novel EvS models.  c) Results show that GRU-based models generally perform best, and MLP performance is often within 5% of the top model; on the Age dataset, using mean hidden state aggregation with a GRU achieves an accuracy of 0.629 ± 0.005.  d) AI practitioners should consider EBES for rigorous evaluation of EvS models and be aware that model performance can be highly dataset-dependent and sensitive to data characteristics like sequence order and timestamps.  Furthermore, the paper notes that results on the PhysioNet2012 dataset were statistically indistinguishable between methods, suggesting limitations for its use in evaluating EvS models.   Follow-up questions:  1.  The paper identifies the learning rate as a crucial hyperparameter.  Could more detail be provided on the HPO search space for the learning rate and other hyperparameters, including ranges and distributions used?  2.  The paper suggests limitations with the PhysioNet2012 dataset.  What specific characteristics of this dataset are believed to contribute to this limitation, and what alternative datasets might be more suitable for benchmarking EvS models in healthcare applications? 3. How easily can EBES be extended to evaluate models for other event sequence tasks beyond sequence-level classification and regression, such as forecasting or imputation?  |


## Papers for 2024-10-08

| Title | Authors | Summary |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Differential Transformer (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05258) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.05258))| Li Dong, thegenerality, sunyt32, yuqxia, ytz20 | This research addresses the problem of Transformers over-attending to irrelevant context in attention mechanisms.  The authors propose a Differential Transformer (DIFF Transformer) using a differential attention mechanism that calculates attention scores as the difference between two softmax attention maps.  Results on language modeling tasks show DIFF Transformer outperforms standard Transformer models, requiring only 65% of the model size or training tokens to achieve comparable performance.  For in-context learning on the TREC dataset, DIFF Transformer improved average accuracy by 5.2% to 21.6% compared to the standard Transformer. This architecture allows AI practitioners to train more efficient and performant large language models.  Here are some follow-up questions an AI practitioner might have:  1. What is the computational overhead of the differential attention mechanism compared to standard softmax attention, particularly with different FlashAttention implementations? 2.  How does the performance of DIFF Transformer compare to other attention-mechanism modifications designed to address similar issues of focusing on irrelevant context, and what are the tradeoffs? 3.  Beyond language modeling, how does the differential attention mechanism perform on other downstream tasks that heavily rely on attention, such as machine translation or image captioning?  |
| LLMs Know More Than They Show: On the Intrinsic Representation of LLM Hallucinations (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02707) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.02707))| Roi Reichart, Zorik Gekhman, belinkov, tokeron, hadasor | This research investigated how large language models (LLMs) encode and represent errors, termed "hallucinations," within their internal activations.  The study employed probing classifiers trained on intermediate LLM representations to predict error presence and type, alongside an analysis of repeated sampling of LLM-generated answers. Probing classifiers trained on the activations of *exact answer tokens* achieved significantly higher error detection performance (AUC of 0.85 on TriviaQA with Mistral-7b-instruct) compared to methods using other tokens.  However, these probing classifiers did not generalize well across datasets representing different tasks, suggesting skill-specific truthfulness encoding.  The study highlights a potential disconnect between LLMs' internal representations and external behavior, where the model may internally encode the correct answer but consistently generate an incorrect one.  A clear quantitative finding comparing probe-based answer selection accuracy vs. greedy decoding across different error types is not presented in a consolidated manner, making direct comparison difficult.   Follow-up questions from an AI practitioner:  1.  Could the "skill-specific" nature of truthfulness encoding be mitigated by multi-task training of the probing classifier, and if so, how would performance compare to single-task training on diverse datasets? 2.  Given the observed discrepancy between internal encoding and external behavior, what specific modifications to the decoding process or model architecture could potentially improve the alignment and reduce erroneous outputs? 3.  How does the performance of exact answer token probing compare to other state-of-the-art error detection methods across a broader range of LLM architectures and sizes, including larger models not tested in this study?  |
| VideoGuide: Improving Video Diffusion Models without Training Through a Teacher's Guide (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04364) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.04364))| Jong Chul Ye, geonyoung-park, bryanswkim, DHCAI | a) The research aims to improve the temporal consistency of pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models without requiring additional training or fine-tuning.  b) VideoGuide interpolates denoised samples from a "guiding" pre-trained VDM (which can be the same as the sampling VDM or a different one) into the denoising process of the main "sampling" VDM during the initial sampling steps.  c)  When applied to AnimateDiff, VideoGuide achieved the best performance across all evaluated metrics, including a subject consistency score of 0.9614, exceeding the base AnimateDiff score of 0.9183.    d) VideoGuide offers AI practitioners a computationally efficient method to enhance the temporal quality of existing T2V diffusion models by leveraging other pre-trained models, potentially combining the strengths of different models without requiring retraining. The paper implies, but does not explicitly state, whether this technique preserves unique features of the sampling VDM, such as controllability.   Follow-up Questions:  1.  How does the choice of the guiding VDM affect the specific aspects of the generated video, such as style, motion, and text coherence, and what strategies can be used for selecting the most effective guiding model for a given task?  2. The paper focuses on 16-frame videos. How does VideoGuide scale with longer video generation and what modifications, if any, are required to maintain performance and computational efficiency?  |
| FAN: Fourier Analysis Networks (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02675) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.02675))| Yongding Tao, Ge Li, Jingjingxu, zkcpku, dongyh | This research investigates how to enable neural networks to effectively model periodicity.  The authors propose Fourier Analysis Networks (FAN), which integrate Fourier Series into the network architecture to explicitly encode periodic patterns.  On symbolic formula representation tasks, FAN consistently outperforms baselines like MLP, KAN, and Transformer as the number of parameters increases. For example, on the task of representing *f(x) = J₀(20x)*, FAN achieves significantly lower test RMSE than other baselines across various parameter sizes. This suggests that AI practitioners can leverage FAN to improve model performance, particularly in domains involving periodic or quasi-periodic data, such as time series analysis and symbolic computation, by replacing standard MLP layers with FAN layers. It is unclear how the comparative parameter and FLOP counts in Table 1 are calculated.  Follow-up questions:  1.  How does the performance of FAN scale with the complexity of the periodic functions being modeled, and what are the practical limitations in terms of computational cost? 2.  Are there specific types of periodic or quasi-periodic data where FAN offers the most significant advantages over other architectures, and are there any scenarios where it might be less suitable?  3.  How robust is FAN to noise in periodic data, and what techniques could be used to further enhance its robustness?  |
| Presto! Distilling Steps and Layers for Accelerating Music Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05167) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.05167))| Jonah Casebeer, Ge Zhu, Njb, tberg12, ZacharyNovack | a) The research aims to accelerate inference in diffusion-based text-to-music (TTM) models by reducing sampling steps and computational cost per step.  b) The authors develop Presto, a dual-faceted distillation approach comprising: Presto-S (step distillation using GAN-based distribution matching), Presto-L (layer distillation with variance preservation and budget awareness), and Presto-LS (combined layer-step distillation).  c) Presto-LS achieves a 10-18x speedup compared to the base model, resulting in a latency of 230/435ms for generating 32-second mono/stereo audio at 44.1kHz on an A100 40GB GPU, while also improving diversity (higher recall) compared to Presto-S.  d) AI practitioners working on real-time or interactive music generation applications can leverage Presto-LS to significantly reduce inference latency without substantial quality loss, potentially enabling new interactive experiences. The paper focuses exclusively on offline generation, and its applicability to real-time or streaming generation remains unclear.   Follow-up questions:  1.  How does Presto-LS perform on longer music pieces (e.g., > 1 minute), and how does the latency scale with duration? 2.  Could the variance preservation technique used in Presto-L be generalized to other diffusion-based generative models beyond music, such as text-to-image or text-to-video? 3. What are the memory and compute requirements for training and deploying the different Presto models (S, L, LS)?  |
| Named Clinical Entity Recognition Benchmark (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05046) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.05046))| Clément Christophe, Tathagata Raha, Muhammad Umar Salman, Marco AF Pimentel, Wadood M Abdul | a) The research aims to establish a standardized benchmark for evaluating Named Clinical Entity Recognition (NER) models in the clinical domain.  b) The benchmark employs a curated collection of publicly available clinical datasets with entities standardized using the OMOP Common Data Model, along with token-based and span-based evaluation metrics (precision, recall, and F1-score) in different averaging modes (Micro and Macro).  Both exact and partial matching strategies are also incorporated.  c) GLiNER-based architectures achieve higher F1-scores (78.25% for condition entities using span-based macro-averaged scores) compared to decoder-only (LLM) models on the clinical NER task.  d) AI practitioners developing clinical NER systems should consider using GLiNER-based models for superior performance compared to decoder-only architectures, particularly for token-level classification tasks where accurate extraction of span information is critical.  Follow-up questions:  1.  Given the performance advantage of GLiNER models over traditional LLMs, what specific adaptations or fine-tuning strategies were used for the GLiNER models included in this benchmark to optimize their performance on the clinical NER task?  2. The paper mentions the issue of label imbalance in clinical datasets. How does this label imbalance affect the evaluation metrics reported, and were any techniques used to mitigate the impact of this imbalance on model training or evaluation?    |
| OmniBooth: Learning Latent Control for Image Synthesis with Multi-modal Instruction (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04932) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.04932))| Xu Yan, Weichao Qiu, bingbl, Evenc, lilelife | a) The research aims to achieve spatial control with instance-level customization in image generation using multi-modal instructions (text and image references) associated with user-defined masks.  b) OmniBooth introduces a "latent control signal" (lc), a high-dimensional spatial feature integrating spatial, textual, and image conditions.  Text embeddings are "painted" into lc, while image embeddings undergo "spatial warping" before integration. A modified ControlNet framework aligns lc with latent image features.  c) On the MS COCO val2017 dataset, OmniBooth achieved a FID score of 17.8, outperforming InstanceDiffusion (FID 23.9) and ControlNet (FID 20.3).  The paper doesn't clarify how the "synthetic COCO val-set" used for evaluation was generated.  d) AI practitioners can leverage OmniBooth to develop image generation models offering users fine-grained control over instance placement and attributes via multi-modal instructions, surpassing the limitations of global prompts or single-modality control. The improved FID score suggests potential for higher quality and more controllable image synthesis.   Follow-up questions:  1. Could you elaborate on the creation of the "synthetic COCO val-set" used for evaluation?  Specifically, how were instance masks and captions generated, and how does this synthetic set relate to the original COCO val2017 set?  2. What are the computational costs (e.g., training time, inference speed) associated with OmniBooth compared to baseline models like ControlNet and InstanceDiffusion?  3. How does the proposed "spatial warping" method handle instances whose reference images significantly differ in aspect ratio or pose from the target mask region?  Does this lead to distortions or artifacts in the generated images?  |
| TLDR: Token-Level Detective Reward Model for Large Vision Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04734) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.04734))| Rui Wang, Tong Xiao, tbpangolin, pzzhang, deqing | a) The research aimed to develop a token-level reward model (TLDR) for multimodal large language models (VLMs) to improve interpretability and granularity compared to traditional binary reward models.  b) TLDR uses a perturbation-based method to generate synthetic hard negatives and token-level labels to train the model, leveraging a pretrained VLM (PaliGemma-3B-Mix-448) and a linear reward model head applied to each token.  c) TLDR achieves 98.6% token-level accuracy and can speed up human annotation by 3 times when correcting synthetic captions.  A correlation of 0.892 (p=0.006) was found between the log of the hallucination rate and MMMU score.  d) TLDR provides AI practitioners with a tool for enhanced self-correction in VLMs, more effective hallucination detection, and faster data annotation for vision-language tasks.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does the performance of TLDR scale with larger VLMs and datasets, particularly with more complex and nuanced visual scenes? 2. Can TLDR be adapted for other multimodal tasks beyond image captioning and VQA, such as visual question generation or image retrieval? 3. What are the computational resource requirements for training and deploying TLDR, and how might these impact practical application in resource-constrained settings?  |
| UniMuMo: Unified Text, Music and Motion Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04534) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.04534))| Yutong Zhang, Kun Su, Han Yang, auspicious3000, Jiaben | a) This research aimed to create a unified model, UniMuMo, capable of generating music, motion, and text in arbitrary combinations conditioned on inputs from any of these modalities.  b) The key methodology involved aligning unpaired music and motion data based on rhythmic patterns, encoding music and motion into a joint token space using a shared codebook, and training a transformer decoder with a novel music-motion parallel generation scheme. A T5 decoder is then fine-tuned for captioning.  c) UniMuMo achieved competitive results on unidirectional generation benchmarks, for example, achieving a CLAP similarity score of 0.29 on text-to-music generation when trained on data containing vocals.  The paper does not provide clear comparisons on combined generation tasks (e.g., text and music to motion).  d) This work provides AI practitioners with a unified framework for multimodal content generation involving music, motion, and text, potentially streamlining development and deployment compared to using separate models for each task.  The impact on real-world combined generation tasks is unclear due to the lack of reported results on such scenarios.   Follow-up questions:  1.  What are the quantitative results of UniMuMo on multi-conditional generation tasks like text-and-music-to-motion or music-and-text-to-motion, as shown in Figure 1, since these seem to be the major contribution differentiating it from other methods? 2. Could the authors provide further insights into the limitations of the rhythmic pattern alignment technique and its potential impact on generating motions for music with complex and varying rhythms? 3. Can the proposed framework be extended to other modalities beyond music, motion, and text, such as image or video?  |
| LLaMA-Berry: Pairwise Optimization for O1-like Olympiad-Level Mathematical Reasoning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02884) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.02884))| Tong Che, Jingdi Lei, schrodingers-tiger, jwu323, qq8933 | This research aims to improve large language model (LLM) performance on complex mathematical reasoning, particularly at the Olympiad level.  The LLaMA-Berry framework utilizes Self-Refine applied to Monte Carlo Tree Search (SR-MCTS) for solution path optimization and a Pairwise Preference Reward Model (PPRM) with Enhanced Borda Count (EBC) for solution evaluation. On the AIME2024 benchmark, the success rate increased from 2/30 (baseline LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct) to 8/30 using LLaMA-Berry.  This suggests that LLaMA-Berry can enhance LLM reasoning ability on difficult benchmarks without additional training, potentially reducing the need for extensive labeled data in complex mathematical problem-solving.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does the computational cost of SR-MCTS and PPRM with EBC scale with increasing model size and problem complexity, and what are the practical implications for deployment? 2.  What is the performance of LLaMA-Berry with different LLMs other than the ones mentioned in the ablation study, especially with larger parameter models and close-source ones? 3. Could the pairwise comparison approach of PPRM be adapted to other domains beyond mathematical reasoning, such as code generation or theorem proving, and what modifications would be required?  |
| MathHay: An Automated Benchmark for Long-Context Mathematical Reasoning in LLMs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04698) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.04698))| cxiong, lunshi, hendrydong, yuhuixu, demolei | This research aims to evaluate the long-context mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs.  The authors developed MATHHAY, an automated benchmark containing 673 mathematical reasoning questions across various topics and difficulty levels, paired with relevant and irrelevant documents forming "haystacks" of 32K-128K tokens.  Evaluation involved both exact match and LLM (GPT-40) judging. Gemini-1.5-Pro-002 achieved the highest overall performance, reaching only 51.26% accuracy at 128K tokens.  This result highlights the significant need for improvement in LLMs' long-context mathematical reasoning capabilities, which is crucial for real-world applications involving complex numerical analysis.  Follow-up questions:  1.  How does the performance of the LLM judge (GPT-40) compare across different question difficulty levels (single-step vs. multi-step) and document placements (First, Middle, Last)?   2.  What specific error analysis was performed to understand the types of mistakes LLMs made on MATHHAY, beyond overall accuracy?   3.  What are the specific criteria used by the GPT-40 LLM judge to determine the correctness of an answer when an exact match is not found?  |
| TurtleBench: Evaluating Top Language Models via Real-World Yes/No Puzzles (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05262) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.05262))| siminniu, fan2goa1, WinfredShi, Ki-Seki, Duguce | This research aimed to evaluate the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in dynamic contexts.  The researchers created TurtleBench, a dataset of 1,532 yes/no questions derived from user interactions with an online "Turtle Soup Puzzle" game, and evaluated nine LLMs using 0-shot and 2-shot prompting.  Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-40 achieved the highest overall accuracy, exceeding 87%, in the zero-shot setting. OpenAI's o1 series models performed significantly worse than expected. The paper suggests that relying solely on latent Chain-of-Thought, as observed in the o1 models, may not be sufficient for complex reasoning tasks and that excessive CoT length can introduce noise.   Follow-up questions:  1.  Given the observed performance disparity between OpenAI's o1 models and other leading LLMs like Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-40 on TurtleBench, what specific architectural or training differences might contribute to this discrepancy?  2.  How does the dynamic nature of the TurtleBench dataset, with its real-time collection of user guesses, prevent data contamination and model cheating compared to static benchmarks, and how can this methodology be applied to other reasoning tasks beyond yes/no puzzles?  3.  The paper mentions a cost analysis for different LLMs, but what are the trade-offs in terms of cost and performance when choosing between commercially available LLMs (like Claude and GPT) versus open-source models (like Llama) for reasoning tasks, considering the findings of this research on TurtleBench?  |
| MonST3R: A Simple Approach for Estimating Geometry in the Presence of Motion (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03825) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.03825))| fcole, trevordarrell, hurjunhwa, irwinherrmann, Junyi42 | a) The research aims to directly estimate dynamic scene geometry from monocular video, addressing challenges in traditional multi-stage approaches.  b) The approach, Motion DUSt3R (MonST3R), adapts the DUSt3R pointmap representation for dynamic scenes by estimating per-timestep pointmaps and aligning them based on static scene elements. It leverages fine-tuning on a combination of synthetic and real-world datasets with depth and pose annotations and introduces optimizations for video-specific tasks like global point cloud alignment and confident static region identification.  c) On the Sintel dataset for video depth estimation, MonST3R achieves an absolute relative error of 0.335 and a percentage of inlier points (δ < 1.25) of 58.5%.  It demonstrates competitive performance on camera pose estimation and promising qualitative results for feed-forward 4D reconstruction.  The paper doesn't clearly define metrics used for 4D reconstruction.  d) MonST3R offers AI practitioners a faster, potentially more robust alternative to traditional optimization-based methods for estimating geometry from dynamic scenes. This is particularly relevant for applications like robotics, augmented reality, and 3D scene understanding.   Follow-up questions:  1.  The paper mentions challenges with handling dynamic camera intrinsics in practice despite the theoretical capability. Could the authors elaborate on the specific nature of these challenges and the manual constraints required? 2.  What are the specific quantitative metrics used to evaluate the 4D reconstruction results, and how does MonST3R compare against other state-of-the-art methods on these metrics? 3.  What are the computational requirements (memory and runtime) for applying MonST3R to longer videos and higher resolutions compared to the reported experiments?  |
| Autonomous Character-Scene Interaction Synthesis from Text Instruction (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03187) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.03187))| thuhsy, YixinChen, awfuact, milleret, jnnan | This research investigates synthesizing multi-stage human-scene interactions (HSIs) directly from text instructions and goal locations.  The authors propose a framework using an autoregressive diffusion model to generate motion segments, incorporating scene representations and a scheduler for autonomous stage transitions.  Quantitative results demonstrate improved motion synthesis over existing methods, achieving a 0.907 F1 score for interactive motion synthesis. The introduced LINGO dataset (16 hours of motion capture data in various indoor scenes) facilitates training models for complex, language-guided HSI generation.  This work provides a unified approach to HSI synthesis, enabling more realistic and autonomous character animation in 3D environments.  However, the paper does not fully describe the architecture of the autonomous scheduler, limiting a full understanding of its functionality.  Follow-up questions:  1.  Can you provide more details on the architecture and training process of the autonomous scheduler? 2.  How does the model handle ambiguous or poorly written text instructions?  What error handling mechanisms are in place? 3.  What are the limitations of the LINGO dataset, particularly regarding the diversity and realism of the interactions?  |
| Grounding Language in Multi-Perspective Referential Communication (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03959) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.03959))| alsuhr, mao1207, ZinengTang | This research investigates how differing visual perspectives affect the success of referential communication between embodied agents.  The authors created a dataset of human-written referring expressions in a 3D environment and evaluated various vision-language models as speakers and listeners, including GPT-40, LLaVA-1.5, Ferret, and Groma.  Fine-grained model Ferret achieved the highest accuracy in comprehending human-written referring expressions at 69.2%, but all models significantly underperformed compared to human-human communication (87.6% success rate).  Fine-tuning LLaVA-1.5 with a preference-based learning approach using data from interactions improved its performance to 69.3% communicative success with human listeners, surpassing GPT-40. This implies that learning from interaction data holds significant potential for enhancing referential communication models, even outperforming stronger pre-trained models.   Follow-up questions:  1. Could the preference-based learning approach be extended to incorporate multi-turn dialogue where clarification requests are allowed, and how would that impact performance? 2. How do the different referential strategies observed in human vs. model-generated expressions affect listener comprehension, and could explicitly training models on these strategies further improve performance? 3. How robust is the fine-tuned LLaVA-1.5 model to different 3D environments and object types not present in the ScanNet++ dataset used for training and evaluation?  |

| Addition is All You Need for Energy-efficient Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00907) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.00907))| Wei Sun, luohy | a) The research investigates whether floating-point multiplication in large neural networks, a computationally expensive operation, can be approximated by integer addition for energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy.  b) The authors propose a Linear-complexity Multiplication (L-Mul) algorithm that approximates floating-point multiplication with integer addition and evaluate its numerical precision and performance on language, vision, and mathematics tasks using various transformer-based language models (LLMs).  The algorithm was compared to different floating-point precisions (bfloat16, float8_e4m3, float8_e5m2) and integrated into attention mechanisms and full model fine-tuning scenarios.  c)  L-Mul using a 3-bit mantissa outperforms float8_e5m2 multiplication in accuracy across various LLMs.  Specifically, on the GSM8k benchmark, using L-Mul in the attention mechanism of Mistral-7b-Instruct-v0.3 increased accuracy to 52.92% compared to 50.19% with float8_e5m2.  d) AI practitioners can potentially reduce the energy consumption of LLM inference and training by replacing floating-point multiplications with the L-Mul algorithm, especially within attention mechanisms, without significant performance degradation.    Follow-up questions:  1. What is the specific hardware implementation of the L-Mul algorithm, and how does it integrate with existing deep learning frameworks and hardware accelerators?  The paper mentions optimal implementation being at the hardware level and limitations with GPU implementation but lacks specific details.  2. How does the performance of L-Mul scale with increasing model size and complexity beyond the models tested in the paper?  Further investigation is needed to understand its generalizability. 3. Are there numerical stability implications when using L-Mul for training, particularly regarding vanishing or exploding gradients, which haven't been discussed in the paper?  |
| NL-Eye: Abductive NLI for Images (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02613) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.02613))| Zorik Gekhman, yonatanbitton, nitay, tokeron, MorVentura | a) The paper investigates the visual abductive reasoning capabilities of Visual Language Models (VLMs), aiming to determine their ability to infer plausible outcomes or causes from visual scenes.  b) Researchers created NL-EYE, a benchmark consisting of 350 image triplets designed to evaluate visual abductive reasoning through plausibility prediction and explanation tasks, using both vision-based and text-based reasoning approaches.  c) VLMs struggled on NL-EYE, with most failing to exceed random baseline performance in plausibility prediction, while humans achieved 83-85% accuracy.    d) This highlights a critical weakness in current VLMs' ability to perform visual abductive reasoning, necessitating further research into improving their ability to reason over visual data, rather than solely relying on text-based information.   Follow-up Questions:  1. Given the VLMs' success with text-based reasoning but failure with image-based reasoning, what specific architectural changes to the visual encoding components might improve performance on NL-EYE?  2. The paper mentions VLM sensitivity to hypothesis order.  What further investigation can be done to isolate whether this is due to limitations in the models' understanding of spatial relationships within the combined images or an inherent bias in the models' sequential processing?  3.  Could providing pre-training data that emphasizes correlational or causal reasoning relationships between images improve VLMs' performance on the various reasoning categories in NL-EYE?  |
| Selective Attention Improves Transformer (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02703) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.02703))| Yossi Matias, Matan Kalman, yanivle | a) The paper investigates whether reducing attention to unneeded elements in a transformer's context can improve performance and efficiency.  b) The researchers introduce "Selective Attention," a parameter-free modification to the standard attention mechanism that allows tokens to mask the attention paid to them by future tokens.  Context pruning is also employed, where sufficiently masked tokens are removed from the context buffer.  c)  Transformers with selective attention and context pruning achieved equivalent validation perplexity on the C4 dataset with up to 47X less memory for their attention module compared to standard transformers, depending on context length and use of an auxiliary loss term.  d) AI practitioners can potentially significantly reduce the memory and computational costs of transformer inference, particularly for long sequences, by implementing selective attention and context pruning without sacrificing performance.  The paper focuses specifically on decoder-only transformers and primarily evaluates on language modeling, leaving applicability to encoders and other tasks unclear.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does Selective Attention compare to other context pruning methods like Dynamic Context Pruning (DCP) in terms of performance trade-offs and implementation complexity on realistic hardware?  2.  How robust are the perplexity gains and memory savings of Selective Attention across different datasets and downstream tasks beyond language modeling?  3.  Does the choice of head used for the selection function significantly impact the results, and is there a principled way to choose the optimal head?  |
| Tutor CoPilot: A Human-AI Approach for Scaling Real-Time Expertise (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03017) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.03017))| Susanna Loeb, ddemszky, carlycodes, Analu, rose-e-wang | a) The study investigated whether a human-LM system, Tutor CoPilot, could improve tutoring quality and student learning in K-12 mathematics. b) A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 900 tutors and 1,800 K-12 students, comparing a treatment group with access to Tutor CoPilot to a control group without access.  NLP classifiers were trained and used to analyze pedagogical strategies employed by tutors. c) Students whose tutors had access to Tutor CoPilot were 4 percentage points more likely to master lesson topics, based on an intent-to-treat analysis. d)  For AI practitioners, this study highlights the potential of integrating human expertise with LMs to enhance performance in complex, real-time interaction domains like education. The results suggest focusing on Human-AI collaborative systems that provide real-time, context-specific guidance to augment human expertise rather than replace it.  Follow-up questions:  1. What were the specific model architectures and training data used for the Bridge method (mentioned in Figure 1 and throughout) and the NLP classifiers used for identifying pedagogical strategies?  More details on the model training and hyperparameter tuning would be helpful for replication or application to other domains. 2. The paper mentions adapting the system to in-person tutoring through speech and visual inputs but doesn't detail how this would be implemented. What specific technical challenges are anticipated in adapting Tutor CoPilot to process and respond to multimodal input in real-time? 3. The paper mentions limitations regarding the generalizability of the findings beyond the specific tutoring context studied.  What steps could be taken to evaluate the robustness and adaptability of the Tutor CoPilot approach across diverse student populations, subject matters, and educational settings?  |
| RoCoTex: A Robust Method for Consistent Texture Synthesis with Diffusion Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19989) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.19989))| Jeonga Wi, Junyoung Choi, Jiun, DK9, longshiine | a) The paper aims to develop a robust text-to-texture generation method for 3D meshes that addresses view inconsistencies, seams, and misalignment issues common in existing diffusion-based approaches.  b) RoCoTex leverages Stable Diffusion XL with multiple ControlNets (depth, normal, edge) for geometric awareness, a symmetrical view synthesis strategy with regional prompts for view consistency, and novel confidence-based texture blending and soft-inpainting techniques using Differential Diffusion for seam reduction.  c) RoCoTex achieved a Kernel Inception Distance (KID) score of 4.03, lower than baseline methods like TEXTure (10.34), Text2Tex (8.15), and Paint3D (6.98), indicating higher quality and diversity of generated textures.  d)  AI practitioners can utilize RoCoTex for efficient and robust generation of high-quality, consistent textures for 3D models, improving the realism and visual appeal of 3D assets in applications like gaming and virtual/augmented reality.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the performance of RoCoTex scale with increasing mesh complexity and texture resolution, in terms of both quality and computational cost?  2. The paper mentions limitations regarding occlusion and lighting; what specific strategies are planned for future work to address these limitations, and are there any preliminary results or insights available?  3. Could the confidence-based blending and soft-inpainting techniques be adapted and applied to other image synthesis tasks beyond text-to-texture generation?  |
| Erasing Conceptual Knowledge from Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02760) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.02760))| David Bau, Samuel Marks, sfeucht, RohitGandikota | This research aims to develop a method for erasing specific concepts from large language models (LLMs) while preserving general capabilities and fluency.  The proposed method, Erasure of Language Memory (ELM), employs targeted low-rank updates (LoRA) and a multi-objective loss function incorporating erasure, retention, and conditional fluency objectives.  On the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) biosecurity multiple-choice questions, ELM reduced model accuracy from 64.4% to near-random performance (29.7%). The key implication for AI practitioners is that ELM offers a technique for mitigating risks associated with LLMs generating undesirable content while retaining performance on unrelated tasks.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does the computational cost of ELM's fine-tuning compare to full retraining or other unlearning methods like RMU and RepNoise, particularly for larger models and datasets? 2. Does the paper provide any analysis of the long-term stability of the erasure, for example, does the erased knowledge reappear after further fine-tuning or general use? 3.  While the paper states that ELM maintains fluency, are there qualitative examples demonstrating the nature of generated text when prompted with the erased concept, beyond the provided multiple-choice question performance?  |
| A Comprehensive Survey of Mamba Architectures for Medical Image Analysis: Classification, Segmentation, Restoration and Beyond (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02362) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.02362))| gduggal, Man1kandan, Madddy, HARI45SH, shubhii0712 | This paper surveys Mamba architectures and their applications in medical image analysis. The objective is to provide a comprehensive overview of Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM)-based architecture for sequence modeling, covering its evolution, architectures, optimizations, and applications.  The survey details various Mamba architectures, including pure Mamba, U-Net variants, and hybrid models, alongside scanning mechanisms and techniques like weakly supervised learning.  On 1248x1248 images, Vision Mamba (ViM) uses 73.2% less memory and is 2.8x faster than DeiT. The survey suggests Mamba’s efficiency and linear time complexity makes it a potent alternative to Transformers for medical image analysis tasks, enabling practitioners to handle long-range dependencies and high-complexity data more effectively.  Follow-up questions:  1.  Given the reported efficiency gains of Mamba over Transformers, what are the practical considerations (e.g., existing library support, ease of implementation, debugging tools) for transitioning existing medical image analysis pipelines from Transformer-based to Mamba-based models? 2.  The paper mentions Mamba's limitations in handling spatial information and non-causal visual data.  Are there specific research directions or modifications to Mamba architectures that could mitigate these limitations and broaden its applicability within medical image analysis? 3.  The survey highlights several Mamba-based U-Net variants.  What are the trade-offs in performance and computational cost among these variants, and how can these trade-offs inform the selection of an appropriate architecture for a specific medical image segmentation task?  |
| CANVAS: Commonsense-Aware Navigation System for Intuitive Human-Robot Interaction (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01273) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.01273))| wpiioos, Unmanned-YuBeen, lastdefiance20, PurpleSand, MilkClouds | This research aimed to develop a robot navigation system capable of interpreting abstract human instructions using commonsense reasoning.  The researchers employed imitation learning, training a vision-language model (CANVAS) on a new dataset (COMMAND) containing 48 hours of human-demonstrated navigation in simulated environments.  In the challenging “orchard” simulated environment, CANVAS achieved a 67% total success rate, compared to a 0% success rate for the rule-based ROS NavStack. This indicates that training with human demonstrations in simulation can enable robust navigation even with noisy or incomplete instructions.  AI practitioners can leverage this approach to develop more user-friendly and adaptable robot navigation systems.  Follow-up questions:  1.  How does CANVAS handle conflicting information between the sketch trajectory and the language instruction, and what strategies are employed to resolve such conflicts during inference?  2.  What specific architectural modifications were made to Idefics2 8B in creating CANVAS-S, beyond simply swapping the vision and text encoders, and what impact did these changes have on performance and efficiency? 3. The paper mentions "randomized starting orientations" for evaluation.  What is the distribution of these orientations, and how does robustness to initial orientation affect practical deployment scenarios?  |
| MIGA: Mixture-of-Experts with Group Aggregation for Stock Market Prediction (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02241) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.02241))| Heming Weng, Genesis Wang, yh1567, zjy2001 | a) The research aimed to improve stock market prediction by addressing the limitations of single end-to-end models in capturing the diverse features of different stock styles.  b) The authors proposed MIGA (Mixture of Expert with Group Aggregation), a two-stage framework employing an expert router to dynamically allocate stocks to specialized experts and an inner group attention mechanism to facilitate information sharing among experts.  c) MIGA-Conv achieved a 24% excess annual return on the CSI300 benchmark, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model by 8%.  It also demonstrated improved performance on ranking metrics like IC and RankIC across CSI300, CSI500, and CSI1000 benchmarks.  d) AI practitioners can leverage MIGA to develop more robust and adaptable financial forecasting models by incorporating the Mixture of Experts framework with specialized experts and group aggregation mechanisms.  The improved performance on unseen data highlights its potential for real-world applications.   Follow-up questions:  1.  The paper mentions an ablation study on scaling the number of experts but doesn't detail the computational cost implications. How does the performance improvement scale with the number of experts, and what are the trade-offs in terms of training time and inference latency?  2.  The paper uses a linear layer for the experts.

The specific ratio of this combination should be explored depending on the desired trade-off. The paper’s findings on the format of captions show DSC+ is preferred by MLLMs while shorter captions are preferred by CLIP, indicating that caption format should be customized to the specific model.  Follow-up questions:  1. What are the computational costs and infrastructure requirements associated with implementing the proposed controllable captioning pipeline, especially for generating captions at the scale of datasets like VeCap-300M?  2.  Could the performance gains observed by combining synthetic captions and AltText be replicated using alternative filtering methods besides DFN-2B, and what challenges might arise when combining different filtering or captioning approaches?  3.

On NEXT-QA, adding the LLaVA-Video-178K dataset during training led to a 31.9-point increase in scores.  d) This provides AI practitioners with a new high-quality synthetic video instruction tuning dataset and a corresponding LMM, enabling improved development of video understanding models beyond simple captioning.  The strong performance increases demonstrate the value of both high-quality, dense annotations and increased frame inclusion within video LMM training.  Follow-up Questions:  1.

This information is crucial for replicating and building upon the research.   |

The paper does not provide quantitative comparisons on publicly available long video generation benchmarks.  d)  AI practitioners can leverage the proposed progressive training and inference strategies to adapt and extend existing LLM-based video generation methods for creating longer, coherent videos, potentially opening new possibilities in content creation and video understanding.  Follow-up questions:  1.

This is particularly impactful as it reduces reliance on expensive, closed-source APIs for evaluating multimodal models, enabling developers with limited resources to perform rigorous testing and alignment.   Follow-Up Questions:  1.

A visually-enriched and spatially-localized captioning pipeline (VESL) generates pseudo-labeled region-text pairs at scale for training.  c) CLOC with 2 billion region labels and a ViT-L/14 architecture achieves 71.1% recall@10 on GRIT region retrieval and improves Ferret MLLM performance on referring description VQA by 6.2% compared to baseline CLIP.  d) AI practitioners can utilize CLOC as a drop-in replacement for CLIP in MLLMs to improve performance on referring and grounding tasks that require fine-grained visual understanding.   Follow-up questions:  1.  The paper mentions working on releasing pre-trained checkpoints and the constructed region-text annotations.

The training protocol combines real and synthetic datasets with a two-stage curriculum focusing first on robust feature learning and then on boundary sharpening.  c) Depth Pro achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot metric depth accuracy with a  δ₁ score of 89.0 on the Sun-RGBD dataset and generates a 2.25-megapixel depth map in 0.3 seconds on a V100 GPU.  d) AI practitioners can utilize Depth Pro for applications requiring fast and accurate metric depth estimation, particularly in scenarios like novel view synthesis where sharp boundaries are crucial, without needing camera intrinsics or per-domain fine-tuning.  The paper's proposed boundary accuracy metrics based on matting/segmentation data offer a valuable new evaluation tool.   Follow-up questions:  1.

The drawn equivalence to Markov chains offers a theoretical basis for interpreting and predicting the behavior of LLMs, especially in in-context learning scenarios.  e) The paper lacks details on the architecture and specific training methodology of the "small GPT-like" toy model used in experiments. It also lacks details on how the prompts are tokenized in the in-context learning experiments.    Follow-up Questions:  1. How robust is the equivalence between LLMs and Markov Chains to different tokenization methods, especially for numerical data, given the observed sensitivities highlighted in the paper?  2. Can the Markov Chain framework be leveraged to develop more efficient fine-tuning strategies or prompt engineering techniques for specific downstream tasks involving sequential data?  3. How does the sparsity of the transition matrix, quantified in the paper, influence the computational complexity of estimating the stationary distribution and mixing time of LLMs represented as Markov chains?  |
| CLIP-MoE: Towards Building Mixture of Experts for CLIP with Diversified Multiplet Upcycling (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19291) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.19291))| Yu Cheng, Jihai Zhang, Spico, Xiaoye08 | This research aims to improve Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) performance by addressing its coarse-grained encoding and information loss. The authors propose Diversified Multiplet Upcycling (DMU), fine-tuning multiple CLIP models with shared parameters (except for Feed-Forward Network layers) using Multistage Contrastive Learning (MCL), then integrating these models as experts into a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. On zero-shot image-text retrieval using the ShareGPT4V dataset, CLIP-MoE achieves a top-1 image-to-text retrieval accuracy of 60.5% on Flickr30k, exceeding the OpenAI CLIP baseline by approximately 22%.  This offers AI practitioners a model-agnostic method to enhance CLIP performance without extensive retraining from scratch, which is particularly relevant for resource-constrained settings.  Follow-up questions:  1. Could the performance gains observed with CLIP-MoE be replicated with different base CLIP architectures (e.g., larger or smaller ViT variants, ResNet-based CLIP)? 2. How does the choice of the number of experts and the top-k routing strategy affect the performance-efficiency trade-off of CLIP-MoE in different downstream tasks and hardware settings? 3. What are the practical considerations for deploying CLIP-MoE in real-world applications, particularly concerning latency and memory footprint compared to standard CLIP models?  |
| Eliminating Oversaturation and Artifacts of High Guidance Scales in Diffusion Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02416) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.02416))| Otmar Hilliges, RMW, msadat97 | a) This paper investigates the oversaturation and artifact generation caused by high classifier-free guidance (CFG) scales in diffusion models, aiming to improve generation quality. b) The authors introduce Adaptive Projected Guidance (APG), which decomposes the CFG update into parallel and orthogonal components, down-weighting the parallel component responsible for oversaturation.  APG also incorporates rescaling and reverse momentum inspired by gradient ascent optimization. c)  APG improved FID scores compared to CFG across multiple models; for example, EDM2-S showed a reduction from 10.42 to 6.49 with a guidance scale of 4. d) APG provides AI practitioners a plug-and-play alternative to CFG that mitigates oversaturation and artifacts at high guidance scales, enabling the use of higher guidance values for enhanced generation quality and alignment with conditional inputs. The most impactful finding is the decomposition of CFG’s update and the subsequent suppression of the parallel component, directly impacting how practitioners can control saturation levels in generated images.  Follow-up questions:  1.  How does the performance of APG compare to CFG when using different text embedding methods or prompt engineering techniques in text-to-image generation? 2.  Could the insights from APG’s decomposition of CFG updates be applied to other guidance methods or even other generative model architectures beyond diffusion models? 3. Are there specific types of conditional inputs (e.g., complex text prompts) where APG's advantages are more pronounced compared to CFG?  |

Follow-up questions:  1. What is the computational overhead of incorporating multi-view training and the proposed densification strategies compared to standard single-view optimization in 3DGS?  How does this impact real-time rendering capabilities?  2.  The paper mentions performance degradation with excessive multi-view training.

| L-CiteEval: Do Long-Context Models Truly Leverage Context for Responding? (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02115) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.02115))| Jianye Hou, Baibei Ji, Juntao Li, Keyan Zhou, ZetangForward | a) This research investigates whether Long-Context Models (LCMs) genuinely utilize provided context for generating responses or rely on inherent knowledge.  b)  A multi-task benchmark, L-CiteEval, was created, requiring LCMs to generate statements and supporting citations from long contexts (8K-48K tokens) across 11 tasks.  Automatic evaluation metrics for both generation quality (e.g., precision, recall, Rouge-L) and citation quality (citation recall, precision, and F1) were used.  c) Open-source LCMs lagged significantly behind closed-source models in citation accuracy, with a performance gap of nearly 20 F1 points observed in some synthetic tasks, despite citing a similar number of segments.  d)  AI practitioners should be aware that current open-source LCMs are prone to generating responses from internal knowledge rather than the provided context, posing risks for faithfulness in applications. The benchmark and its automatic evaluation suite provide a tool for evaluating and improving context utilization in LCM development.  e) The paper notes a correlation between LCM attention mechanisms and the citation generation process but doesn't provide details on the strength or nature of this correlation.   Follow-up questions:  1.  What specific architectural differences between the tested open-source and closed-source LCMs could be contributing to the disparity in citation accuracy?    2.  How does the choice of retrieval method in the RAG approach impact both generation and citation quality across different task types and context lengths?  3.  Can the observed correlation between attention mechanisms and citation generation be leveraged to develop more explainable or controllable LCMs for long-context tasks?  |
| Training Language Models on Synthetic Edit Sequences Improves Code Synthesis (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02749) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.02749))| Rob Fergus, lerrel, upiter | a) This research investigates whether training language models (LLMs) on synthetic code edit sequences, rather than complete programs, improves code synthesis performance, particularly in terms of the trade-off between generation quality and inference-time compute cost.  b) The authors develop LintSeq, an algorithm that refactors existing programs into sequences of static error-free edits using a linter.  LLMs are then instruction fine-tuned on these synthetic edit sequences and evaluated on code synthesis benchmarks.  c) On HumanEval, smaller LLM's (e.g., TinyCodeLM-150M and 400M) fine-tuned on synthetic edit sequences outperform existing code language models of comparable size and achieve a 20% (±3%) absolute improvement in pass@50 compared to baseline fine-tuning on full program code.  d) For AI practitioners working with smaller LLMs, this research suggests that fine-tuning on synthetic edit sequences generated using a tool like LintSeq can significantly improve code synthesis performance and provide a more favorable trade-off between computational cost and generation quality, enabling competitiveness with larger models using repeated sampling.   Follow-up questions:  1.  How does the performance of LintSeq-trained models compare to baseline models on other code synthesis benchmarks beyond HumanEval and MBPP, especially those involving longer or more complex code generation? 2.  What are the practical limitations and computational costs associated with generating and storing large datasets of synthetic code edits using LintSeq for training larger LLMs? 3.  How robust is the LintSeq approach to different programming languages and how can it be adapted for other code editing tasks besides program synthesis, such as code completion or bug fixing?  |
| Distilling an End-to-End Voice Assistant Without Instruction Training Data (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02678) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.02678))| Michael Ryan, Ella Li, zyanzhe, missblanchett, WillHeld | a) The research aimed to develop a Speech Large Language Model (Speech LLM) that generalizes well without requiring instruction training data, addressing the "forgetting" issue observed in models fine-tuned with supervised finetuning (SFT).  b) The study employed a cross-modal context distillation method, training a model named Distilled Voice Assistant (DiVA) on the CommonVoice dataset. DiVA leverages a frozen Llama 3 language model and a Q-Former initialized from Whisper, minimizing the L2 distance between audio and text embeddings and the KL Divergence between their output distributions.  c) DiVA generalized to Spoken Question Answering, Classification, and Translation tasks.  In a user study comparing DiVA with Qwen 2 Audio, DiVA achieved a 72% win rate based on user preference.  d) This research provides AI practitioners with a data-efficient and computationally less expensive approach to developing Speech LLMs that generalize well, potentially reducing the reliance on extensive labeled instruction datasets.  The significant user preference for DiVA over existing SFT models suggests a potential disconnect between benchmark evaluations and real-world user experience.    Follow-up questions:  1. How does DiVA's performance compare to SFT models on a broader range of spoken language understanding tasks beyond those evaluated in the paper?  2. What are the limitations of using context distillation for tasks where prosodic information in speech plays a crucial role, and how can these limitations be addressed?  3. How does the choice of the base LLM affect DiVA’s performance, and could performance be further improved by using a more powerful LLM or by fine-tuning the LLM's parameters?  |

The model was evaluated on 10 medical image segmentation tasks from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset.  c) The integration of the Llama 3.1 LLM transformer block improved the average Dice score from 0.74 (baseline ViT) to 0.79.  d) AI practitioners working on medical image segmentation tasks can leverage pre-trained LLM layers to boost the performance of ViT models without requiring larger datasets or excessive computational resources for LLM training. The paper notes the improved effectiveness seen at higher image resolutions, which could guide practitioners in model selection for specific tasks.   Follow-up questions:  1.  The paper mentions a Hybrid Attention mechanism. How does this mechanism's design specifically contribute to the observed performance gains, and what are the computational trade-offs compared to standard attention mechanisms in ViTs?  2.  Given the observation that lighter LLMs like Yi and Qwen performed well, what specific architectural factors within these models might be contributing to their effectiveness in medical image segmentation compared to heavier models like Llama and Gemma?  Further research directly comparing these architectures on more datasets would be very insightful.  3.  While the paper focuses on the MSD dataset, how generalizable are these findings to other medical imaging modalities or datasets with varying characteristics (e.g., noise levels, resolution)? Would further investigation on private datasets reveal a similar performance boost?  |
| Vinoground: Scrutinizing LMMs over Dense Temporal Reasoning with Short Videos (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02763) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.02763))| Jianrui Zhang, yjlee0222, mucai | a) The research investigates the ability of large multimodal models (LMMs) to perform dense temporal reasoning in short videos.  b) A new benchmark dataset, Vinoground, consisting of 1000 short video-caption pairs with temporal counterfactuals, was created and used to evaluate several CLIP-based and text-generative LMMs.  Models were tasked with matching videos to captions differing only in temporal ordering of events.  c) GPT-40 achieved the highest text score among LMMs at 54.0%, significantly below human performance (~90%), and all CLIP-based models performed worse than random chance.  d)  The results demonstrate a significant deficiency in current LMMs regarding dense temporal reasoning, even in short videos, highlighting this as a critical area for future development and refinement.  The paper's introduction states that a "single-frame bias" exists in current video-language benchmarks and therefore the community has shifted its attention toward more complex challenges posed by long-form video understanding; however, the results reported in this paper suggest that short-form video comprehension is itself a problem that is far from being solved.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the performance of LMMs on Vinoground vary with different video encoding strategies, such as varying the number of sampled frames or using different temporal fusion methods?  2.  What specific architectural modifications or training paradigms could be explored to improve LMMs' ability to capture and reason about the temporal dynamics present in videos?  3. Could transfer learning from pre-trained models specialized in action recognition or temporal ordering improve performance on Vinoground, and how could such transfer learning be effectively implemented?  |
| Synthio: Augmenting Small-Scale Audio Classification Datasets with Synthetic Data (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02056) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.02056))| manocha, ctnzr, rafaelvalle, ZhifengKong, SreyanG-NVIDIA | This research aims to improve audio classification accuracy with limited labeled data.  The Synthio method augments small-scale datasets using synthetic audio generated from a text-to-audio (T2A) diffusion model aligned with the target dataset using preference optimization and prompted with diverse captions generated by LLMs.  Evaluation on ten downsampled datasets showed Synthio outperformed baselines by 0.1%-39% in classification accuracy. This implies that AI practitioners can leverage synthetic data generated from aligned T2A models, coupled with diverse captioning techniques, to significantly improve the performance of audio classification models trained on limited data.  Follow-up questions:  1.  How does the computational cost of Synthio, including LLM prompting and T2A generation, compare to the cost of collecting and labeling more real-world audio data? 2.  The paper mentions limitations regarding the T2A model's occasional inability to match generated audio with captions compositionally; how could this limitation be addressed to improve Synthio's applicability to tasks like audio captioning? 3.  Could the preference optimization technique used to align the T2A model be adapted or improved for other generative models beyond audio, such as image or text generation?   |

| From Code to Correctness: Closing the Last Mile of Code Generation with Hierarchical Debugging (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01215) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.01215))| Xiaodong Gu, Chengcheng Wan, Songsong Wang, YerbaPage | This research addresses the problem of low pass rates in LLM-generated code due to subtle errors.  The authors introduce MGDebugger, which uses a hierarchical, bottom-up debugging strategy, decomposing code into subfunctions and debugging them recursively with LLM-simulated execution and automatically generated test cases.  Experiments on HumanEval show MGDebugger improves accuracy by 17.7% over seed generations when using DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite (16B).  This implies that AI practitioners can significantly improve the correctness of LLM-generated code by adopting hierarchical debugging strategies rather than treating programs as monolithic units. The paper states MGDebugger achieves a 97.6% repair success rate on HumanEval-Fix using DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite (16B); however, it doesn't clarify the baseline repair success rate for this dataset/model combination, making it difficult to assess the relative improvement.  Follow-up questions:  1.  How does MGDebugger's performance compare to traditional symbolic execution or program analysis techniques for debugging, especially in terms of scalability and handling complex codebases? 2.  What are the computational resource requirements (e.g., memory, time) of MGDebugger compared to other LLM-based debugging methods, and how do they scale with code size and complexity? 3.  Could the hierarchical decomposition strategy be automated further, and what are the potential challenges in applying it to real-world codebases with complex dependencies and interactions between modules?  |
| Is Preference Alignment Always the Best Option to Enhance LLM-Based Translation? An Empirical Analysis (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20059) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.20059))| nunonmg, PierreColombo, CelineH, emmanuelmalherbe, hgissbkh | a) This paper investigates the effects of preference-based alignment, particularly Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO), on the quality of Large Language Model (LLM)-based translations.  b) The researchers conducted experiments fine-tuning an LLM translation model with CPO and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), using various quality metrics (xCOMET-QE, CometKiwi, chrF) for alignment and evaluation, with both multi-system and mono-system candidate generation approaches.  c) CPO consistently outperformed SFT on high-quality data when aligning with neural metrics like xCOMET-QE, sometimes significantly increasing scores on the alignment metric (e.g.,  +2.75 for xCOMET-QE in en-xx translations with a multi-system approach). However, it also introduced adverse effects between neural and lexical metrics, and exhibited sensitivity to the chosen candidate systems.  d) AI practitioners aligning LLMs for translation should carefully consider the choice of candidate generation systems and potential trade-offs between optimizing neural versus lexical metrics when employing CPO.  The instability of CPO across different downstream metrics warrants caution.  The mono-system approach offers more control and may mitigate some of these issues while achieving comparable alignment effectiveness.  This improved control stems from being able to fine-tune the choice of candidate option quality with greater precision in the mono-system setting.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the computational cost of generating multiple candidates in the mono-system approach compare to the cost of accessing and using multiple external systems in the multi-system approach?  2.  Could the instability of CPO be addressed by exploring different values for the β hyperparameter or by modifying the training procedure (e.g., different optimizers, learning rate schedules)?  3. What are the practical implications of the adverse metric effects between neural and lexical metrics for real-world translation applications, where both types of metrics are often considered important?  |
| LEOPARD : A Vision Language Model For Text-Rich Multi-Image Tasks (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01744) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.01744))| Zhihan Zhang, Tianqing Fang, Mengzhao Jia, kaixinm, wyu1 | This research aimed to develop a multimodal large language model (MLLM) capable of handling text-rich, multi-image tasks.  The researchers curated a one-million-instance instruction-tuning dataset (LEOPARD-INSTRUCT) and implemented an adaptive high-resolution multi-image encoding module based on pixel shuffling.  LEOPARD-Idefics2, a variant trained on this dataset, outperformed the previous best-performing open-source MLLM on text-rich multi-image benchmarks by an average of 9.61 points.  This suggests that LEOPARD and its associated dataset are valuable resources for developing MLLMs specialized in complex, text-rich, multi-image scenarios.  The paper doesn't explicitly state the metric used for the +9.61 point improvement, though it does mention average normalized levenshtein similarity and accuracy in Table 3, making it difficult to understand precisely what this improvement represents.   Follow-up questions:  1. What specific metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, etc.) was used to calculate the +9.61 point improvement on the multi-image text-rich benchmarks, and on which specific subset of benchmarks was this average calculated? 2. What is the computational cost (e.g., GPU hours, FLOPs) of training LEOPARD compared to baseline models, and how does the adaptive high-resolution encoding module impact inference time? 3. Can the adaptive high-resolution encoding module be effectively applied to other visual encoders besides SigLIP-SO-400M, and are there plans to release the LEOPARD-INSTRUCT dataset publicly?  |
| ComfyGen: Prompt-Adaptive Workflows for Text-to-Image Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01731) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.01731))| galchechik, cohenor, yuvalalaluf, adihaviv, rinong | a) This research aims to improve text-to-image generation quality by automatically tailoring workflows to individual user prompts.  b) The authors propose two LLM-based approaches: ComfyGen-IC uses an LLM with a pre-computed table of flows and scores for prompt categories to select flows, while ComfyGen-FT fine-tunes an LLM to predict flows based on prompts and target scores.  Both leverage ComfyUI, representing workflows as JSON.  c) ComfyGen-FT outperforms baseline models and generic workflows on both human preference and prompt alignment benchmarks, achieving a 0.61 overall score on GenEval compared to 0.59 for the best baseline.  d)  This work indicates that AI practitioners can improve text-to-image generation quality by moving beyond fixed models or generic workflows and adopting prompt-adaptive workflow generation techniques.  Specifically, fine-tuning LLMs to predict workflows based on both prompts and target scores shows promise for enhanced performance.  Follow-up questions:  1. What are the computational costs and scalability challenges associated with training and deploying ComfyGen-FT, particularly for large datasets and complex workflows?  2. How does the performance of ComfyGen-FT vary across different LLM architectures and sizes, and what are the trade-offs between performance and computational resources?  3. Can the proposed framework be extended to other generative tasks beyond text-to-image generation, such as image editing or video generation, and what adaptations would be necessary?  |
| Not All LLM Reasoners Are Created Equal (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01748) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.01748))| Aaron Courville, Daniel Toyama, Alessandro Sordoni, agarwl, arianhosseini | This research investigates the depth of grade-school math (GSM) problem-solving and reasoning capabilities of LLMs.  The study evaluates LLM performance on Compositional GSM, a new dataset derived from GSM8K, requiring models to solve chained math problems where the answer to the first question is a variable in the second. Results reveal a significant reasoning gap, defined as the performance difference between solving compositional pairs and individual questions; for example, the smaller, more cost-efficient GPT-40 mini exhibits a 14.2% reasoning gap on compositional GSM despite high accuracy on GSM8K.  This implies that instruction-tuning, while effective for single-step problem-solving, does not necessarily translate to improved multi-hop reasoning, and high scores on standard benchmarks may mask deficiencies in compositional reasoning abilities, a critical insight for AI practitioners developing and applying such models.   Follow-up Questions:  1.  What specific modifications were made to the GSM8K problems to create the Compositional GSM dataset, and how might these modifications differentially impact various LLM architectures or training paradigms? 2.  Given the observed overfitting during finetuning on GSM8K, what alternative training strategies could be explored to improve compositional reasoning without sacrificing generalization performance on other tasks? 3. Could the study's findings about the reasoning gap in cost-efficient models be extrapolated to other problem domains beyond grade-school math, and if so, what are the implications for real-world AI applications where resource constraints are a major factor?  |
| 3DGS-DET: Empower 3D Gaussian Splatting with Boundary Guidance and Box-Focused Sampling for 3D Object Detection (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01647) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.01647))| Dan Xu, Yuanliang, YangCaoCS | a) The paper aims to introduce 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for 3D object detection, addressing the challenges of ambiguous spatial distribution and excessive background blobs encountered when adapting 3DGS to this task.  b) The authors propose a novel method called 3DGS-DET, incorporating two key strategies: 2D Boundary Guidance, which utilizes object boundaries from posed images to train the 3DGS model, and Box-Focused Sampling, which constructs 3D object probability spaces based on 2D bounding boxes for probabilistic sampling of Gaussian blobs.  c) On the ScanNet dataset, 3DGS-DET achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 59.9 at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold of 0.25, surpassing the baseline 3DGS pipeline by 5.6 points.  d) AI practitioners can leverage the proposed 3DGS-DET method to achieve improved performance in 3D object detection tasks by utilizing the explicit and efficient representation offered by 3DGS, enhanced with boundary and sampling strategies.  The paper specifically notes that other detectors can potentially use the enhanced 3DGS representations.  Follow-up questions:  1. Could the performance of 3DGS-DET be further improved by jointly training the 3DGS representation and the detection network, rather than training them sequentially?  2. How does the computational cost of Boundary Guidance and Box-Focused Sampling compare to other 3D object detection methods, particularly those based on point clouds or voxels?  3.  The paper mentions using CAGroup3D and FCAF3D as detectors.  Could the specific detector choice significantly impact the results observed?  Would other detectors trained on point clouds yield similar improvements from using the 3DGS representations?  |

They also experiment with a novel combined approach, initializing a Scaled Bradley-Terry model with a Helpfulness-Only SteerLM Regression model, and further refining it with ExPO.  c) The combined reward model (Scaled BT + EXPO) achieves 94.1% on RewardBench, outperforming over 140 other reward models as of October 1, 2024.  d)  AI practitioners can leverage this combined reward model and the HelpSteer2-Preference dataset for training more accurate reward models, especially for RLHF, and potentially improve the performance of language models at following instructions.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does the performance of the combined reward model (Scaled BT + EXPO) vary across different RewardBench categories (Chat, Chat-Hard, Safety, Reasoning), and what are the potential reasons for such variations?  2. What are the computational resource requirements (e.g., memory, FLOPs) for inference with the combined reward model compared to individual Bradley-Terry or Regression models?  3. What specific techniques were used for pre-processing the preference justifications, and how did those pre-processing steps impact the performance of Pairwise Justifier models?  |
| RATIONALYST: Pre-training Process-Supervision for Improving Reasoning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01044) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.01044))| Guoxuan Wang, danyaljj, ChuyuLiu, ylu610, Dongwei | a) The research aims to improve the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by addressing the issue of incomplete reasoning chains with implicit rationales.  b) The proposed method, RATIONALYST, involves extracting implicit rationales from unlabeled text (The Pile) and reasoning datasets (GSM8K and ECQA), training a model to predict these rationales, and using the predicted rationales to provide process-supervision during LLM inference.  c) Fine-tuned from LLaMa-3-8B, RATIONALYST improves the accuracy of reasoning by an average of 3.9% on seven representative reasoning benchmarks, including mathematical, commonsense, scientific, and logical reasoning datasets.  d) AI practitioners can use RATIONALYST to enhance the reasoning performance and interpretability of LLMs across various tasks by incorporating a process-supervision mechanism based on implicit rationales extracted from readily available unlabeled data.  The improved interpretability is particularly important for debugging and gaining deeper insights into LLM's reasoning process.    Follow-up Questions:  1. How does the performance of RATIONALYST scale with larger base LLMs (e.g., LLaMa-3-70B) or more powerful rationale extractors (e.g., GPT-4)? 2. What are the computational costs and infrastructure requirements associated with extracting and filtering rationales from large datasets like The Pile, and how can these be optimized? 3. Could RATIONALYST be adapted for specific domains or tasks by training it on a curated dataset of domain-specific rationales, and how would this impact its performance and generalizability?   |
| Quantifying Generalization Complexity for Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01769) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.01769))| maxtiktok, Nrain, zhuokai, Xulianghuang, luohy | This research investigates how task complexity and model size affect the generalization ability of Large Language Models (LLMs).  The study uses SCYLLA, a dynamic benchmark generating in-distribution and out-of-distribution data for 20 tasks across varying complexities.  Results reveal a "generalization valley," where the performance gap between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data is non-monotonic, peaking at a "critical complexity" that shifts rightward with increasing model size.  Specifically, LLaMA-3.1-405B achieved near-perfect generalization scores (0.997 and 0.996) on O(N) and O([N, N²]) tasks, respectively. This suggests that scaling LLM size improves generalization, delaying but not eliminating over-reliance on memorization at higher task complexities.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the specific distribution of OOD data generation in SCYLLA affect the observed generalization valley, and how would these results compare if alternative OOD sampling strategies were employed?  2. Given the implicit reasoning observed in models like o1-mini, what further analysis could be conducted to better understand and potentially leverage these capabilities in downstream tasks or model development?  3.  Could the performance of specialized LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-7B) at higher complexities be improved by utilizing multi-stage prompting that decomposes complex tasks into sub-tasks within their expertise range?  |
| EVER: Exact Volumetric Ellipsoid Rendering for Real-time View Synthesis (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01804) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.01804))| George Kopanas, Alexander Mai, xharlie, dorverbin, phedman | a) The research aims to develop a real-time, differentiable, emission-only volume rendering method that addresses the limitations of existing techniques like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), particularly "popping" artifacts.  b) The proposed method, Exact Volumetric Ellipsoid Rendering (EVER), represents the scene as a collection of constant-density ellipsoids and uses ray tracing to compute the volume rendering integral exactly.  This allows for the inclusion of effects like defocus blur and fisheye lens distortion.  c) EVER achieves a framerate of 30 FPS at 720p resolution on an NVIDIA RTX4090 on the challenging Zip-NeRF dataset and achieves a lower LPIPS score (0.368) compared to existing real-time methods like 3DGS (0.418) and StopThePop (0.411).  d) AI practitioners working on novel view synthesis can use EVER to generate high-quality, pop-free renderings in real-time, enabling applications that require fast and consistent 3D scene representations. The paper does not state the impact on memory usage, nor quantify inference time on hardware other than an NVIDIA RTX4090.  Follow-up questions:  1.  How does the memory footprint of EVER compare to 3DGS, particularly when scaling to even higher resolution or more complex scenes? 2.  Could the constant density assumption of EVER be relaxed to allow for more complex density variations within individual primitives, and how would that impact performance and quality? 3. What is the performance (FPS and quality metrics) of EVER on other commonly used GPUs, besides the NVIDIA RTX 4090 mentioned in the paper?  |
| E.T. Bench: Towards Open-Ended Event-Level Video-Language Understanding (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18111) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.18111))| Ying Shan, Yang Wu, Zhongang Qi, Zongyang Ma, Ye Liu | a) This research addresses the lack of fine-grained event-level and diverse task assessment in current video-language understanding benchmarks, aiming to create a more comprehensive evaluation for Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs).  b)  The authors introduce E.T. Bench, a benchmark with 7.3K samples across 12 tasks and 8 domains, focusing on event-level and time-sensitive understanding of long videos. They also propose E.T. Chat, a novel Video-LLM using embedding matching for timestamp prediction, and E.T. Instruct 164K, a dedicated instruction-tuning dataset.  c) State-of-the-art Video-LLMs struggle with E.T. Bench, especially on grounding and dense captioning tasks, while E.T. Chat achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models, with a 38.4% Accref (averaged accuracy on referring tasks) on E.T. Bench.  d)  AI practitioners developing Video-LLMs should consider incorporating finer-grained temporal understanding and multi-event scenarios in training data and model design, prioritizing both spatial and temporal reasoning capabilities for improved performance on complex video understanding tasks. The paper notes potential data leakage in benchmark evaluation due to overlap with existing datasets used for model training, which might affect the validity of zero-shot evaluation.    Follow-up questions:  1.  Given the limitations of discrete token prediction for timestamps, what other alternative approaches besides embedding matching could be explored for improving temporal understanding in Video-LLMs?  2. How can the E.T. Bench benchmark be improved to mitigate the potential data leakage issue mentioned in the paper and ensure a more robust evaluation of Video-LLMs in zero-shot settings?  3. What specific architectural modifications in E.T. Chat contribute to its superior performance on grounding and dense captioning tasks compared to other state-of-the-art open-source Video-LLMs?  |

An experience memory and world model complement the planner.  c) Evaluated on VirtualHome-Env, the method achieved a success rate improvement of up to 19% with error correction compared to not using error correction. It shows superior scaling for inference computation.  d) This provides AI practitioners a supervised learning approach to train self-refining LLM planners for robotics without needing complex reinforcement learning or process supervision, potentially leading to more robust and efficient long-horizon task completion.  Follow-up questions:  1. What are the specific architectural details of the world model used, and how does its performance compare to more complex world models that simulate environmental states rather than just feedback?  2. How does the proposed method's computational cost during training and inference scale with increasing model size and task complexity compared to alternative approaches like Tree-Planner or SELF-REFINE?  3.  The paper mentions failure scenarios like hallucination and lack of history awareness.

This is particularly relevant to generative AI application developers.   **Follow-Up Questions:**  1. How does the performance of HarmoniCa scale with even larger DiT models and higher resolutions beyond those tested in the paper (e.g., greater than 2048x2048)? 2.  Could the proxy mechanism in IEPO be further refined to more accurately represent final image error, potentially leading to further performance gains? 3. What is the memory footprint of HarmoniCa during inference, and how does it compare to other acceleration techniques like pruning or quantization, particularly for resource-constrained environments?  |
| Selective Aggregation for Low-Rank Adaptation in Federated Learning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01463) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.01463))| Huijie Fan, Liangqiong-QU, yanranw1, stevezs, gpx333 | a) This paper investigates how to effectively aggregate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) matrices in Federated Learning (FL) for improved performance on downstream tasks.  b) The authors introduce Federated Share-A LoRA (FedSA-LORA), where both A and B matrices of the LoRA update are trainable during local training, but only the A matrices (responsible for general knowledge) are aggregated on the server. This method is then generalized to other LoRA variants (rsLoRA and VeRA).  c)  On the GLUE benchmark's RTE task with a severe non-IID data distribution, FedSA-LoRA achieved 90.20% accuracy, outperforming standard LORA (88.80%) and FFA-LoRA (88.83%).  d) AI practitioners can use FedSA-LoRA to efficiently fine-tune large language models in federated learning settings, especially with non-IID data, by reducing communication overhead and improving performance compared to existing methods. The impactful finding, that A matrices capture general knowledge while B matrices learn client-specific knowledge, allows for more targeted aggregation and better generalization across clients.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the performance of FedSA-LoRA scale with the number of clients and the heterogeneity of the data distribution in more complex real-world scenarios beyond the presented experiments?  2.  What are the computational and memory overheads of FedSA-LoRA compared to other PEFT methods in federated settings, particularly for very large language models?  3.  How robust is FedSA-LoRA to malicious client behavior, and what mitigation strategies could be implemented to enhance its security in adversarial federated learning environments?  |

| Law of the Weakest Link: Cross Capabilities of Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19951) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.19951))| xwhan, ruihou16, xwwang, astonzhang, MingZhong | The paper investigates the under-explored area of cross-capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), defined as the intersection of multiple abilities required for complex tasks.  The authors introduce CROSSEVAL, a benchmark comprising 1400 human-annotated prompts across seven individual and seven cross-capabilities, and use LLM-based evaluators to assess model responses.  Results reveal that cross-capability performance is often constrained by the weakest individual capability, exhibiting a "Law of the Weakest Link," where 38 out of 58 cross-capability scores from 17 models fell below all individual capability scores.  This highlights the need to focus on improving weaker capabilities for better overall performance.  Follow-up questions:  1.  How can CROSSEVAL be extended to encompass a wider range of cross-capabilities and incorporate more nuanced evaluation metrics beyond the 1-5 Likert scale? 2.  What specific training strategies can be employed to effectively address the "Law of the Weakest Link" and improve LLM performance in tasks requiring multiple abilities? 3.  How can the insights from this research be applied to the development and evaluation of LLM-based agents operating in real-world scenarios?  |

It also reduced the peak memory footprint of Llama 2-70B by 90%, requiring only 3.1 GB of memory per device.  d)  TPI-LLM offers AI practitioners a viable solution for deploying and running large-scale LLMs on edge devices, addressing privacy concerns and limitations in memory and computing power, thus enabling broader LLM applications on edge devices.   Follow-up questions:  1.  What is the impact of varying the size of the sliding window on the trade-off between memory footprint and inference speed in real-world scenarios with diverse network conditions?  2. How does TPI-LLM perform with quantized LLMs, and what are the potential trade-offs between model accuracy and efficiency when using quantization on edge devices?  3. Could the star-based allreduce algorithm be further optimized for heterogeneous edge device clusters with varying compute power and network latency characteristics?  |

The researchers construct a large instruction dataset from diverse sources, including existing Darija resources, manually and synthetically created data, and translated English instructions.  Fine-tuned 2B and 9B parameter Gemma models, Atlas-Chat, show superior performance compared to other LLMs like LLaMa, Jais, and AceGPT, achieving 58.23% and 81.89% accuracy on DarijaMMLU and Sentiment Analysis, respectively, with the 9B model.  This work demonstrates successful LLM adaptation for a low-resource dialect.  Follow Up Questions:  1. What specific pre- and post-processing techniques were used for the English-to-Darija translation of the instruction datasets, and how did these impact the final model performance?  2.  How does the performance of the smaller 2B model compare to the 9B model in resource-constrained environments, considering factors like inference speed and memory usage?  3.  What are the limitations of the current evaluation benchmarks for Darija, and what further work is needed to develop more comprehensive and robust evaluation metrics for this dialect?  |

It also outperforms previous methods by achieving 67.7% J&F on Ref-DAVIS-17.  d) AI practitioners can leverage VideoLISA for video object segmentation tasks requiring complex reasoning and temporal understanding, potentially unifying image and video segmentation tasks under a single foundation model. The paper suggests post-optimization can further improve mask quality, but the extent of improvement isn't quantified.  Follow-up Questions:  1. What is the computational cost of VideoLISA compared to traditional video object segmentation models, and how can it be optimized for real-time applications?  2.  How robust is the One-Token-Seg-All approach to long videos with significant object occlusions or transformations, and what strategies could be explored to improve its robustness in such challenging scenarios?  3.  The paper mentions the limitations of the MLLM's reasoning capabilities being bounded by the underlying language model.  What specific types of reasoning failures were observed, and how can prompt engineering or alternative LLM architectures address these limitations?  |
| Illustrious: an Open Advanced Illustration Model (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19946) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.19946))| Junha Lee, leehg57, mhy9910, solbon1212, andyp-nvidia | a) The research aimed to develop an open-source, state-of-the-art anime image generation model, Illustrious, surpassing existing models in terms of animation style, high resolution, dynamic color range, and restoration ability.  b) The key methodology involved training on a large, refined dataset of anime images with multi-level captions (tags and natural language descriptions), utilizing a No Dropout Token approach for preserving specific concepts, and training at higher resolutions (up to 2.25MP) to enable high-resolution output. The training used Stable Diffusion XL as a base, with modifications including Cosine Annealing scheduler and Input Perturbation Noise Augmentation.  c)  Illustrious v1.1 achieved a median CCIP (Character Consistency Image Prompt) score of 0.99 in a character similarity evaluation.

| Can Models Learn Skill Composition from Examples? (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19808) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.19808))| Sanjeev Arora, Anirudh Goyal, Simran Kaur, Haoyu Zhao, dingliyu | This research investigates whether fine-tuning can improve compositional generalization in LLMs, specifically their ability to combine language skills in novel ways.  The study fine-tuned LLaMA-2-13B-Chat and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 on a dataset generated by GPT-4, consisting of text samples exhibiting combinations of 1, 2, or 3 language skills.  Results showed that fine-tuning on these examples improved the models' ability to compose up to 5 held-out skills, with LLaMA-2-13B-Chat's success rate for composing 3 held-out skills increasing from 4% to 37%. This suggests that models can learn a "meta-skill" of composition, generalizing beyond specific skill combinations seen during training.  AI practitioners can leverage this finding by incorporating skill-rich (potentially synthetic) text data into training to improve the compositional capabilities of LLMs.   Follow-up Questions:  1. What is the impact of varying the size and diversity of the training dataset (beyond the current 13,957 samples) on the compositional generalization performance?  2.  How does this fine-tuning approach compare to other methods for improving compositional generalization, such as curriculum learning or specific architectural modifications?  3.  Beyond the SKILL-MIX evaluation, how can this improved compositional ability be effectively applied to more complex, real-world NLP tasks, and what are the potential limitations in such applications?  |

The paper highlights the importance of pairwise feedback data and robust reward models in training effective feedback systems.  Follow-up questions:  1.

Are there experiments or analyses planned to address this potential dependency? 3.  While the paper demonstrates improved performance on specific benchmarks, how well does this generalize to real-world code editing scenarios in diverse programming languages and codebases beyond competitive programming and the provided test sets?  |

The proposed dual-embedding strategy reduces localization time overhead by approximately 40-50% compared to existing methods. d)  AI practitioners working on audio security and copyright protection can utilize IDEAW for robust and efficient watermark embedding and extraction, improving localization speed significantly compared to traditional approaches.  Follow-up questions:  1.  How does the performance of IDEAW vary across different audio genres and lengths, beyond the speech and music datasets used in the evaluation? 2. What is the computational complexity of IDEAW's embedding and extraction processes, and how does it scale with increasing audio length or watermark payload size? 3.

This method allows for substantial model compression and faster inference speeds without significant accuracy degradation, useful for deploying LLMs on resource-constrained devices. The paper doesn't detail the computational cost of VPTQ compared to other methods like GPTQ aside from quoting inference throughput.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the memory bandwidth requirement of VPTQ during inference compare to GPTQ and other scalar quantization methods, given the need to load codebooks? 2. What is the detailed breakdown of the quantization algorithm execution time (10.4-18.6%) – which steps contribute most significantly, and how can these be further optimized? 3.  The paper mentions layer-wise finetuning. What is the specific process and its impact on final model accuracy and quantization time compared to not finetuning or performing full finetuning?  |
| Modulated Intervention Preference Optimization (MIPO): Keep the Easy, Refine the Difficult (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17545) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.17545))| fetong | This research aimed to improve preference optimization for large language models (LLMs) by addressing the limitations of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The authors proposed Modulated Intervention Preference Optimization (MIPO), which modulates the influence of a reference model during training based on the alignment between the reference model and each preference pair, measured using differences in average log-likelihood. On AlpacaEval 2.0, MIPO achieved a 9.05% higher win-rate than DPO using Llama3-8B-Instruct and an 8.19% higher win-rate using Mistral-7B-Base. This suggests that MIPO can facilitate more effective alignment of LLMs with human preferences compared to DPO by focusing training effort on instances where the reference model needs more improvement.  The paper does not discuss computational complexity differences between MIPO and DPO.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the computational cost of MIPO compare to DPO, considering the additional computation required to calculate and integrate the modulation factor q(K)? 2. Could the performance gains observed with MIPO on AlpacaEval 2.0 and MT-Bench generalize to other preference optimization tasks and datasets? 3. What are the practical considerations for selecting the hyperparameter β in MIPO, and is there a more principled approach to tuning this parameter beyond the empirical analysis presented?  |

| Pixel-Space Post-Training of Latent Diffusion Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17565) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.17565))| Felix Juefei-Xu, Ji Hou, Matthew Yu, Simran Motwani, Christina Zhang | This research paper proposes a novel approach to improve the quality of images generated by Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) by incorporating a pixel-space loss function during the post-training phase. The authors argue that operating solely in the compressed latent space, as is typical for LDMs, can lead to loss of detail and artifacts in the generated images. By adding a pixel-space objective during fine-tuning, either supervised or preference-based, the model learns to better preserve high-frequency details, resulting in significantly enhanced visual quality and fewer flaws in the generated images. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on both DiT and U-Net based LDMs, showing significant improvements in visual appeal and reduction of visual flaws without compromising text alignment. This technique provides AI practitioners, particularly those working with image generation, a simple yet effective method to enhance the quality of images generated by LDMs without architectural modifications, potentially leading to higher fidelity and more realistic image synthesis.   |

| Instruction Following without Instruction Tuning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14254) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.14254))| Christopher D. Manning, Percy Liang, Nelson F. Liu, John Hewitt | This research paper investigates instruction following in language models without explicit instruction tuning. The authors identify two implicit instruction tuning approaches: response tuning (training on responses only) and single-task fine-tuning (training on a narrow domain). Surprisingly, both approaches yield models capable of following general instructions, even surpassing base models in performance.  This suggests that instruction-response mappings might be implicitly learned during pretraining, and seemingly unrelated fine-tuning tasks can implicitly enhance instruction-following capabilities.  This finding holds practical relevance for practitioners, emphasizing the need for comprehensive testing and safety evaluations even for models fine-tuned for specific tasks, as they may exhibit unintended general instruction-following behavior.   |

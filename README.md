| Law of Vision Representation in MLLMs | chenfengx, WaterInSea, Ye27, Borise, shijiay | The research paper "Law of Vision Representation in MLLMs" explores the crucial role of vision representation in the performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). It proposes a "Law of Vision Representation" which asserts that the performance of an MLLM is linearly correlated with a newly defined "Alignment and Correspondence score" of the vision representation. This score measures cross-modal alignment and correspondence between the visual and textual features, offering a more comprehensive evaluation than traditional empirical methods. Leveraging this law, the authors introduce an "AC policy" to efficiently select optimal vision representations, leading to a significant reduction in computational cost and energy consumption. This research provides valuable insights for practitioners in the field of MLLMs by offering a deeper understanding of vision representation selection and a practical approach to optimize MLLM performance.   | [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16357) |

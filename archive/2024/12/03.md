This work provides a framework for building more practical and user-friendly instance navigation systems by reducing the burden of providing detailed upfront instructions.  |
| VLSBench: Unveiling Visual Leakage in Multimodal Safety (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19939) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.19939))| Jing Shao, Xuanjing Huang, LLLeo612, Max9803, Foreshhh | VLSBench, a new multimodal safety benchmark, is designed to address visual safety information leakage (VSIL) in existing multimodal datasets.  The research aimed to understand why textual alignment performs comparably to multimodal alignment on existing multimodal safety benchmarks, suspecting a VSIL problem. The authors constructed VLSBench with 2.4k image-text pairs, preventing leakage from image to text through an automated pipeline involving harmful query generation, detoxification, iterative image generation, and filtration.  Multimodal alignment methods outperformed textual alignment methods on VLSBench, with the best close-source model (Gemini-1.5-pro) achieving a 49.78% safety rate. This highlights the need for AI practitioners to prioritize multimodal alignment over textual alignment when addressing safety in multimodal models, especially in scenarios where sensitive visual content is not explicitly described in the text.  |
| INCLUDE: Evaluating Multilingual Language Understanding with Regional Knowledge (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19799) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.19799))| atcbosselut, jjzha, jebish7, shayekh, angelika | INCLUDE benchmarks multilingual LLMs' understanding of regional knowledge.  The study investigates how large language models perform on questions requiring cultural and regional knowledge across diverse languages.  Researchers compiled a novel dataset of 197,243 multiple-choice questions from local exams in 44 languages and 15 scripts, avoiding translation artifacts by using original-language sources and annotating questions for regionality and academic domain.  GPT-4 achieved the highest overall accuracy of 77.1% on the INCLUDE-BASE subset.

The research aims to boost the success probability of LLMs by increasing test-time compute, specifically addressing the challenge of ensuring high reliability in high-stakes scenarios. The proposed algorithm involves generating multiple candidate solutions and selecting the best one through a knockout tournament with pairwise comparisons.  On a subset of the MMLU-Pro benchmark, the algorithm's accuracy improved from approximately 60% to over 65% for the "engineering" category when scaling the number of initial candidate solutions (N) from 1 to 32 with comparison parameter K=2 using Llama3.1.  AI practitioners can leverage this method to enhance LLM reliability for complex tasks by scaling test-time computation with provable performance guarantees, provided the underlying assumptions regarding solution generation and comparison probabilities hold.  |
| Towards Cross-Lingual Audio Abuse Detection in Low-Resource Settings with Few-Shot Learning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01408) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2412.01408))| Noel Crespi, Reza Farahbaksh, callmesan | This paper explores cross-lingual few-shot learning for audio abuse detection in low-resource languages.  The research objective is to develop a model capable of detecting abusive language in multiple Indian languages using limited labeled data.  The methodology involves extracting audio features using pre-trained Wav2Vec and Whisper models, normalizing these features using Temporal Mean or L2-Norm, and classifying them with a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) based few-shot classifier.  Whisper with L2-Norm normalization achieved the highest accuracy, reaching 85.22% for Malayalam in the 100-shot setting.  AI practitioners can leverage pre-trained audio representations and meta-learning techniques to develop robust abuse detection systems for low-resource languages, even with limited labeled data, highlighting the potential for improved content moderation across diverse linguistic groups.  |

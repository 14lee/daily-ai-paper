They evaluate different data recipes and compare MMGIC with image-caption data.  4. **Primary Results:**    Experiments showed that multi-grained concept annotations in MMGIC integrate and complement each other, leading to improved performance on 12 multimodal comprehension and generation benchmarks. For instance, the appropriate combination of MMGIC with image-caption data achieved a 3.95% absolute improvement over image-caption data alone on the POPE benchmark.  5. **Principal Implication for AI Practitioners:**    AI practitioners can leverage the MMGIC dataset and the proposed training framework to develop MLLMs with enhanced capabilities in aligning vision and language at multiple granularities, leading to better performance on downstream vision-language tasks.  |

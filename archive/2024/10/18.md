Multi-stage training with progressive resolution scaling and supervised fine-tuning was employed for video generation. c)  MovieGen outperformed existing models on text-to-video generation, achieving a 35.02% net win rate against Runway Gen3 on overall video quality.  It is unclear from the paper if these are cherry-picked examples or comprehensive benchmarks. d) AI practitioners can leverage MovieGen’s architecture and training techniques to develop high-quality video generation and editing models, pushing the state-of-the-art in media generation and manipulation.  The focus on scaling data, model size, and compute resources highlights the importance of these factors for achieving superior results in generative AI for media.   Follow-up questions:  1.

| Harnessing Webpage UIs for Text-Rich Visual Understanding (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13824) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.13824))| Yuxiao Qu, Yifan Song, yuexiang96, oottyy, jeepliu | a) This research aims to improve text-rich visual understanding in multimodal large language models (MLLMs).  b) The authors construct MultiUI, a 7.3-million-sample dataset synthesized from 1 million website UIs using text-based LLMs to generate multimodal instructions paired with UI screenshots. The dataset covers nine tasks across three categories: visual understanding and reasoning, text recognition, and grounding.  Models are then trained on MultiUI and tested on both web UI and general multimodal benchmarks.  c) Models trained on MultiUI achieve up to a 48% improvement on VisualWebBench and generalize to non-web UI domains like document understanding and chart interpretation, indicating the broader applicability of web UI data.  d) AI practitioners can leverage web UI data as a powerful resource for training MLLMs in text-rich visual understanding, enabling models to perform well across a broader range of tasks beyond just web UI-specific scenarios. The surprising generalization to non-UI domains highlights the potential for cross-domain knowledge transfer when using this type of data.    Follow-up questions:  1.  What specific techniques were used to clean and process the accessibility trees to ensure they were suitable for LLM processing, and how did this impact the quality of the generated instructions?  2.  While the paper demonstrates promising cross-domain generalization, what are the limitations of this approach, and what further research could be done to mitigate these limitations, particularly in domains with visually distinct characteristics from web UIs?  3.  Could the methodology for creating synthetic training data from web UIs using LLMs be adapted or extended to create datasets for other multimodal tasks, such as video understanding or audio-visual scene analysis?  |

The authors propose MMed-RAG, a multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system incorporating domain-aware retrieval, adaptive context selection, and RAG-based preference fine-tuning.  On medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) and report generation tasks across five datasets, MMed-RAG improved the factual accuracy of Med-LVLMs by an average of 18.5% for VQA and 69.1% for report generation compared to the original Med-LVLM.  This suggests that MMed-RAG's components effectively mitigate misalignment issues introduced by incorporating retrieved knowledge.  AI practitioners can leverage MMed-RAG to improve the factuality and reliability of Med-LVLMs for real-world medical applications.  Follow-up questions:  1. What are the specific architectural details of the domain identification module within the domain-aware retrieval mechanism, and how is its performance evaluated in isolation? 2.  How does the computational cost of MMed-RAG during inference compare to the original Med-LVLM and other baseline methods, considering the overhead of retrieval and context selection? 3.  How robust is MMed-RAG to noisy or incomplete retrieved contexts, and what mitigation strategies could be employed to further enhance its reliability in such scenarios?  |
| A Unified View of Delta Parameter Editing in Post-Trained Large-Scale Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13841) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.13841))| Keming Lu, Hongyu Lin, Bowen Yu, Le Yu, TangQiaoYu | a) This paper aims to establish a unified framework for understanding how various delta parameter editing operations (pruning, quantization, etc.) affect the performance of post-trained large-scale models.  b) The research analyzes delta parameter editing through the lens of Riemann sum approximation of the loss function difference between post-trained and edited models.  c)  Experiments on ViT, LLaMA 3, Qwen 2, and Mistral models showed that DARE can eliminate up to 99% of delta parameters while maintaining competitive performance.  The paper doesn't provide enough quantitative detail to compare other editing operations besides DARE across all models and datasets tested.  d) AI practitioners can use the Riemann sum approximation framework to predict the performance impact of different delta parameter editing techniques and to design new editing methods for improved model compression or performance enhancement. The impact is especially relevant for model compression, as demonstrated by the success of DARE in significantly reducing model size without substantial performance loss.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the choice of the constant *C* in the Riemann sum approximation affect the accuracy of the performance predictions for different model architectures and datasets?  2. Can the proposed framework be extended to analyze the effects of delta parameter editing in the context of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods?  3.  Beyond the average magnitude, what other holistic statistics of delta parameters could be explored in the quantization approach, and how can we systematically evaluate their effectiveness?  |

The models are then trained using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).  c) PopAlign achieved a 19.0% win rate against GPT-3.5 on AlpacaEval 2.0 (length-controlled), compared to 11.8% for the base Yi-6B-Chat model.  d) AI practitioners can leverage PopAlign to create more comprehensive alignment datasets, potentially leading to more robust and less susceptible LLMs by distilling diversified contrasting patterns across the response generation workflow.  The paper suggests "Elicitive Contrast" is particularly effective.  e)  The paper mentions using Yi-34B-Chat and Vicuna-33B for Leaderboard Contrast, citing a training data quality gap as the main performance differentiator. It is unclear whether other factors (e.g., architecture, training methodology) were controlled for.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does PopAlign's performance scale with larger LLMs and datasets, and what are the computational resource implications? 2. Can the "Elicitive Contrast" strategy be further optimized or adapted for different LLM architectures or tasks? 3.

| MoH: Multi-Head Attention as Mixture-of-Head Attention (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11842) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.11842))| Shuicheng Yan, Li Yuan, Bo Zhu, Chat-UniVi | This research aims to improve the efficiency of multi-head attention in Transformer models while maintaining or exceeding accuracy. The authors propose Mixture-of-Head attention (MoH), which uses a router to select a subset of attention heads for each token and employs a weighted summation of the selected heads' outputs.  Experiments with MoH-LLaMA3-8B showed an average accuracy of 64.0% across 14 benchmarks, a 2.4% improvement over LLaMA3-8B while using only 75% of the attention heads. This implies that MoH can enable more efficient use of computational resources in attention-based models without sacrificing performance.  The paper doesn't specify the proportion of shared versus routed heads used in MoH-LLaMA3-8B.  Follow-up questions:  1.  What are the computational costs and latency implications of the routing mechanism in MoH compared to standard multi-head attention, and how do these scale with model size? 2.  How does the performance of MoH change when different criteria are used for selecting shared attention heads (besides simply selecting the first *n* heads)? 3.  Could the two-stage routing strategy be further optimized for different modalities, like vision or audio, and how would this impact performance and efficiency?   |

Masked reference attention and a reweighted diffusion loss are introduced to balance subject learning and motion control.  c) On a curated single-subject video dataset, DreamVideo-2 achieved a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.670 for motion control, outperforming baseline methods.  The paper does not provide specifics on the dataset's size or composition besides mentioning 230,160 training videos and a test set with 50 subjects and 36 bounding boxes.  d) AI practitioners can use DreamVideo-2 to efficiently generate customized videos without requiring computationally expensive fine-tuning, simplifying the process of subject-driven video creation.  The balance achieved between subject fidelity and motion control offers greater customization control.   Follow-up questions:  1. What are the computational requirements (e.g., GPU memory, training time) of DreamVideo-2 compared to fine-tuning based approaches like DreamVideo and MotionBooth?  2.  How does DreamVideo-2 handle complex motion patterns or occlusions of the subject during video generation, and what limitations exist in its motion control capabilities?  3. What is the license of the created dataset and the trained models, and are there any restrictions on usage, especially for commercial use-cases?  |
| VidPanos: Generative Panoramic Videos from Casual Panning Videos (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13832) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.13832))| Shiran Zada, Roni Paiss, Erika Lu, Jingwei Ma, fcole | a) The research aims to synthesize coherent panoramic videos from casually captured panning videos of dynamic scenes.  b) The method projects input video frames onto a panoramic canvas, then completes spatiotemporal gaps using diffusion-based (Lumiere) and token-based (Phenaki) generative video models adapted with coarse-to-fine synthesis and spatial aggregation to overcome limited context windows.  c)  On a synthetic dataset with ground truth, the Lumiere-based method achieves a lower LPIPS score (0.05/0.09 on static/dynamic regions) compared to the best baseline (ProPainter with 0.10/0.19).  d) AI practitioners can leverage this technique to generate immersive panoramic videos from limited-FOV panning inputs, enabling novel video creation and viewing experiences. The significant improvement in LPIPS compared to existing inpainting techniques suggests improved perceptual quality for generating realistic and temporally consistent panoramic videos.  e) The paper lacks specific quantitative results on real-world panning videos, relying primarily on qualitative comparisons.  Follow-up questions:  1.  How does the performance of the proposed method compare to baseline methods on metrics besides LPIPS, such as FID, particularly on real-world video datasets?  2.  What are the computational resource requirements and runtimes for generating panoramic videos of varying lengths and resolutions using the proposed method with the different generative video models?  3.  How robust is the method to variations in camera motion beyond pure panning, such as zooming or tilting, and what are the failure modes in these scenarios?  |
| Retrospective Learning from Interactions (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13852) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.13852))| Anne Wu, Gloria Geng, Yiwei Chen, Mustafa Omer Gul, Zizhao Chen | a) This research investigates whether implicit feedback signals in multi-turn human-LM interactions can be used to improve LM performance without explicit annotations. b) The RESPECT method decodes implicit feedback (positive, neutral, or negative) from past interactions using the LLM itself and retrains the LLM using supervised learning, REINFORCE-style policy gradient, or KTO. This is deployed in MULTIREF, a multi-turn referential game with abstract images. c)  In a live deployment setting, the best-performing system (B-SUP, binary feedback with supervised learning) improved task completion rate from 31% to 82% over six rounds of interaction and retraining. d) This implies that AI practitioners can leverage implicit feedback signals present in user interactions to continually improve LLM performance in deployed systems without requiring costly explicit annotations.  The effectiveness of leveraging negative feedback, however, remains unclear and requires further investigation.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the performance of RESPECT compare to traditional RLHF methods in terms of both effectiveness and cost efficiency, considering the annotation effort involved in each? 2. What are the limitations of the current feedback decoder, and what strategies can be explored to improve its accuracy and robustness, especially in handling more complex and nuanced feedback signals? 3. How does the choice of the underlying LLM architecture and size impact the effectiveness of RESPECT, and is there an optimal LLM configuration for this retrospective learning approach?  |
| FlatQuant: Flatness Matters for LLM Quantization (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09426) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.09426))| Kang Zhao, Han Bao, Haoli Bai, Yuxuan Sun, lianlio | a) The paper investigates the impact of weight and activation flatness on the effectiveness of Large Language Model (LLM) quantization and proposes a method to improve it.  b) The authors introduce FLATQUANT, a post-training quantization approach employing learnable affine transformations with Kronecker decomposition and a lightweight training objective to enhance flatness.  An efficient kernel fuses affine transformations and quantization into a single operation for reduced overhead.  c) FLATQUANT achieved less than 1% accuracy drop for 4-bit weight and activation quantization on LLaMA-3-70B, surpassing SpinQuant by 7.5% in accuracy.  d) AI practitioners can leverage FLATQUANT to significantly reduce the memory footprint and accelerate inference of large language models with minimal accuracy degradation, enabling deployment on resource-constrained hardware. The key impact is the ability to deploy larger, more accurate LLMs with significantly improved inference speed thanks to efficient quantization.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does FLATQUANT's performance compare to other quantization techniques in terms of memory savings and computational efficiency on different hardware platforms besides the RTX3090?  2. What is the impact of different calibration dataset sizes and compositions on FLATQUANT's performance, particularly for domain-specific LLMs?  3. Does FLATQUANT’s effectiveness generalize to other model architectures beyond the LLaMA family, such as Mixture-of-Experts models?  |

However, the paper lacks details on specific hardware testing for mobile deployment, although it references prior work demonstrating the feasibility of running such sized models on mobile hardware.   Follow-up questions:  1. What are the specific latency and power consumption metrics of MedMobile on representative mobile devices during inference, and how do these compare to larger LMs?  2.  What are the specific privacy implications of deploying MedMobile on mobile devices, and what mitigation strategies are recommended for handling sensitive patient data within this context?  3. Given that retrieval augmentation did not improve performance, what alternative techniques could be explored to further enhance MedMobile's clinical knowledge and reasoning capabilities while remaining within mobile-size constraints?  |
| Failing Forward: Improving Generative Error Correction for ASR with Synthetic Data and Retrieval Augmentation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13198) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.13198))| Jian Xue, Peidong Wang, Michael Levit, Mohammad Sadegh Rasooli, Sreyan Ghosh | This research investigates the limited generalization ability of Generative Error Correction (GEC) models for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).  The authors propose DARAG (Data- and Retrieval-Augmented Generative Error Correction), which augments GEC training with synthetic speech-transcript pairs generated by LLMs and TTS models and incorporates retrieval-augmented correction for named entities using a datastore.  Experiments across five ASR datasets show DARAG improves WER by 8%-30% in in-domain settings and 10%-33% in out-of-domain settings. This implies that AI practitioners can significantly improve ASR performance by training GEC models on a diverse and consistent set of errors similar to those encountered during testing, including explicit NE knowledge.   Follow-up Questions:  1. What are the computational costs and infrastructure requirements for implementing DARAG, especially for very large datasets or low-resource languages? 2. How does the choice of specific LLM and TTS models used for synthetic data generation affect DARAG's performance and potential biases? 3.  Can the proposed phoneme-aware NE retrieval method be further elaborated, and are there any comparative evaluations against other retrieval techniques for this specific use-case?   |

Follow-up questions:  1.  The paper mentions heuristic initialization for the diagonal matrix. What is the specific impact of different heuristic initialization methods (e.g., constant, uniform, normal) on the performance and stability of LoLDU across different model architectures and datasets? 2.  How does the computational cost of the initial LDU decomposition compare to the overall training time saved by LoLDU, particularly for very large models?  Does the one-time cost of LDU decomposition become negligible as training progresses? 3. Could the authors elaborate on the integration of LoLDU within different deep learning frameworks and the practical considerations for implementing it in real-world production settings?  |
| BenTo: Benchmark Task Reduction with In-Context Transferability (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13804) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.13804))| Lichao Sun, Ming Li, Hongyu Zhao, zhoutianyi | a) The paper investigates how to reduce the number of tasks in large language model (LLM) benchmarks without significantly impacting evaluation quality.  b) The authors propose In-Context Transferability (ICT), a training-free method using in-context learning to estimate task transferability, and Benchmark Task Reduction (BENTO), which formulates task selection as a facility location problem based on the ICT similarity matrix.  c)  BENTO can reduce the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark to 5% of its original size (3 out of 57 tasks) while inducing only a <4% difference in evaluation accuracy compared to the full benchmark, averaged across nine LLMs.  d) This method offers AI practitioners a cost-efficient way to evaluate LLMs, reducing computational overhead while maintaining evaluation reliability.  It allows more rapid model assessment by using a smaller, representative subset of benchmark tasks.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the performance of BENTO vary with different hyperparameter settings for in-context learning (number of exemplars, number of trials), particularly when applied to other benchmarks beyond MMLU and FLAN?  2.  Given the identified clustering structure of benchmark tasks, could ICT and BENTO be adapted to create more specialized, smaller benchmarks focused on specific LLM capabilities or domains, rather than general-purpose evaluation?  3.  How robust is the BENTO-reduced benchmark to adversarial attacks compared to the full benchmark, and are there strategies to mitigate this potential vulnerability while retaining the efficiency gains of task reduction?  |

The most impactful finding is the effectiveness of the Softmax-only architecture, as it drastically reduces computational overhead while maintaining reasonable performance, demonstrating a promising direction for efficient PI.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does the performance of AERO on downstream tasks, such as text classification or question answering, compare to baseline models and other PI-optimized architectures, and does the reduction in nonlinearity affect the model's ability to generalize?  2.  Could the entropy regularization technique be adapted or generalized for other architectures beyond transformer-based LLMs, or for other applications that experience similar issues with entropic overload or collapse?  3. What are the memory implications of AERO during training and inference, particularly for larger models and context lengths, compared to the baselines and SOTA, and how does AERO scale with model size during training and inference in a PI setting?  |

It also incorporates token merging and Gaussian pruning for improved memory efficiency.  c)  Long-LRM reconstructs scenes from 32 images at 960x540 resolution in 1.3 seconds on a single A100 80G GPU, achieving a PSNR of 23.86 on the DL3DV-140 benchmark, comparable to optimization-based 3D GS which takes 13 minutes.  d)  AI practitioners can now leverage a feed-forward model for rapid large-scale scene reconstruction, significantly accelerating applications in 3D content creation and novel view synthesis. The demonstrated ability to process long sequences of high-resolution images efficiently opens possibilities for improved real-time 3D applications.   Follow-up questions:  1.

Analyzing Ethical Biases and Jailbreak Vulnerabilities in AI Systems (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13334) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.13334))| Isack Lee, hbseong | a) This research investigates whether intentional biases in Large Language Models (LLMs), introduced for safety alignment, create vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks, and how these vulnerabilities differ across demographic groups.  b) The researchers developed PCJailbreak, a method using LLM-generated keyword pairs representing privileged and marginalized groups in conjunction with harmful prompts, to measure jailbreak success rates across different LLMs. They also proposed PCDefense, a prompt-based defense mechanism to mitigate jailbreak attacks without additional inference.  c)  In GPT-40, jailbreaking success rates differed by 20% between non-binary and cisgender keywords and 16% between white and black keywords, even with identical prompt structures beyond the keywords.  d) LLM developers must carefully consider the potential for safety-induced biases to be exploited by malicious actors, necessitating the development and implementation of more robust defense mechanisms against jailbreak attacks, such as prompt-based mitigation techniques that don't require significant additional compute resources.  e) The paper mentions a learning-based jailbreak method, GCG, but doesn't clearly explain the details of its implementation within their comparative analyses, leaving some ambiguity in how directly their proposed approach compares to established methods.    Follow-up questions:  1.  How does PCDefense compare in effectiveness to existing defense mechanisms like Guard Models, considering the trade-off between computational cost and robustness?  2.  The paper mentions the LLM-generated keywords - what specific prompts were used to generate these keywords, and what is the degree of variation in the generated keywords between different LLMs?  3.

| $γ-$MoD: Exploring Mixture-of-Depth Adaptation for Multimodal Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13859) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.13859))| Xiaoshuai Sun, Yiyi Zhou, Jiayi Ji, Gen Luo, YaxinLuo | a) The paper investigates how to reduce the computational cost of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) while maintaining performance, focusing on minimizing "activated tokens" rather than parameters.  b) The authors propose γ-MoD, a plug-and-play adaptation strategy integrating Mixture-of-Depths (MoDs) into existing MLLMs.  A novel metric called Rank of Attention Maps (ARank) guides MoD layer placement, complemented by a shared vision-language router and masked routing learning to optimize token skipping.  c) γ-MoD achieved a 51.6% reduction in FLOPs and a 53.2% inference time speedup on LLaVA-HR with an average performance decrease of only 1.5% across four benchmark datasets (GQA, SQA, MMMU, TextVQA).  d) AI practitioners can use γ-MoD to significantly improve the efficiency of existing MLLMs during both training and inference with minimal performance trade-offs, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained environments.  The plug-and-play nature and demonstrated generalizability across different MLLM architectures and sizes simplify integration into existing workflows.   Follow-up questions:  1.

| Toward Guidance-Free AR Visual Generation via Condition Contrastive Alignment (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09347) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.09347))| Jun Zhu, Peize Sun, Hang Su, ChenDRAG | a) The research aims to improve autoregressive (AR) visual generation by removing the reliance on computationally expensive classifier-free guidance (CFG) while maintaining high sample quality.  b) The paper proposes Condition Contrastive Alignment (CCA), a fine-tuning method that contrasts positive and negative image-condition pairs to align pretrained AR models to a target sampling distribution equivalent to that achieved by CFG.  c) CCA significantly improves the FID score of a LlamaGen-L (343M parameter) model from 19.07 to 3.41 and the IS score from 64.3 to 288.2 after one epoch of fine-tuning on ImageNet, achieving near-CFG performance without guided sampling.    d)  AI practitioners can use CCA to reduce the computational cost of AR visual generation by approximately half compared to CFG, potentially simplifying the implementation and deployment of these models.    Follow-up questions:  1. How does CCA's performance compare to CFG when evaluated on other datasets beyond ImageNet, particularly those with more complex scenes or different image resolutions?  2. While CCA eliminates the need for a separate unconditional model during sampling, it still appears to require one during training.  Could the training procedure be modified to completely remove this dependency?  3. The paper mentions combining CCA with CFG. Are there specific guidelines for selecting hyperparameters in this combined approach to achieve optimal performance, and what are the practical computational cost implications of this hybrid method?   |

(Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13854) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.13854))| Xinrun Du, Yuelin Bai, Xi Feng, zhangysk, MING-ZCH | a) The research evaluates the ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to understand higher-order implications and cultural nuances within Chinese images. b)  A new benchmark, CII-Bench, containing 698 Chinese images and 800 multiple-choice questions across six domains, was created and used to evaluate several MLLMs and LLMs with varying prompt configurations. Human evaluation was also included for comparison. c) The highest accuracy achieved by an MLLM on CII-Bench was 64.4%, significantly lower than the average human accuracy of 78.2%. d) MLLMs struggle with complex cultural elements in Chinese imagery and emotion understanding, significantly impacting their performance in accurately interpreting implicit meanings; therefore, AI practitioners should focus on improving MLLMs' ability to process complex cultural context and nuanced emotional information within visual content.  Follow-up questions:  1.  What specific architectural modifications or training strategies could be employed to enhance MLLMs' understanding of culturally specific imagery and symbolism? 2. How can the evaluation metric based on GPT-4 for Chinese traditional paintings be further refined to provide more granular insights into the specific areas where MLLMs struggle with cultural understanding? 3.

| Minimum Tuning to Unlock Long Output from LLMs with High Quality Data as the Key (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10210) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.10210))| Yunlin Mao, Jintao Huang, Daoze, wangxingjun778, Yingda | This research investigates how data quality impacts the tuning of large language models (LLMs) for generating long-form text outputs.  The authors curated a high-quality dataset (LongWriter-6K-filtered) by removing entries from an existing dataset (LongWriter-6K) that lacked output length specifications or had large discrepancies between requested and actual output length. Tuning Qwen2-7B-Instruct with the curated 666-sample dataset resulted in a 9.22 point improvement in the combined length and quality score compared to using the original LongWriter-6K dataset. This indicates that high-quality, task-aligned data is crucial for efficiently tuning LLMs for long output generation, enabling comparable performance improvements with significantly less training data. The authors do not clearly specify how the 9.22-point improvement is calculated or what the absolute starting score was.   Follow-up questions:  1. How is the combined length and quality score (S) calculated, and what were the baseline S scores for the untuned models used in the experiments? 2. Could the authors elaborate on the computational cost savings achieved using the smaller, curated dataset compared to the larger, original dataset, and how this translates into practical benefits for LLM deployment? 3. What specific techniques were used for data cleansing beyond removing entries based on missing length or length discrepancies, and how were these chosen?  |

This is achieved through layer-wise feature distillation, class-specific feature distillation, and score distillation, combined with a mixture-of-agents gating mechanism for knowledge integration.  c) On 11 visual recognition benchmarks under a base-to-novel generalization setting, TransAgent, using CLIP ViT-B/16, outperforms CoOp by approximately 10% on average and 20% on EuroSAT.  d) AI practitioners can leverage TransAgent to improve the performance of CLIP-like models in diverse downstream tasks, particularly under low-shot conditions, without incurring additional computational cost in the inference phase due to the distillation approach. The paper does not explicitly detail the computational cost of the training/distillation phase.  Follow-up questions:  1. What is the computational overhead of the TransAgent training process compared to standard prompt tuning methods, and what are the trade-offs in terms of resource utilization?  2.  How does the performance of TransAgent scale with the number and diversity of the incorporated agent models, and are there limitations to integrating an even wider range of agents?  3. Could the TransAgent framework be adapted for other VLM architectures beyond CLIP, and what modifications would be necessary?  |

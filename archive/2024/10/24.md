| MIA-DPO: Multi-Image Augmented Direct Preference Optimization For Large Vision-Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17637) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.17637))| conghui, KennyUTC, yhcao, yuhangzang, ziyuliu | a) The research aims to improve the ability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to understand and reason with multi-image inputs, addressing the issue of hallucinations in these scenarios.  b) The authors introduce Multi-Image Augmented Direct Preference Optimization (MIA-DPO), which extends single-image datasets to multi-image contexts by incorporating unrelated images and uses attention values to select rejected responses for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training.  c) MIA-DPO improved performance on five multi-image benchmarks, achieving an average boost of 3.0% on LLaVA-v1.5 and 4.3% on InternLM-XC2.5.  d) MIA-DPO offers a cost-effective and scalable approach for aligning LVLMs with human preferences in multi-image contexts, without relying on manual annotations or expensive APIs.  This allows AI practitioners to enhance the multi-image reasoning capabilities of LVLMs using existing single-image data.   Follow-up Questions:  1. How does the performance of MIA-DPO vary across different LVLM architectures beyond LLaVA and InternLM, and what modifications might be needed for optimal application to other models?  2.  What are the computational resource requirements of MIA-DPO compared to other preference optimization methods, particularly regarding the attention-based selection process?  3. Could the attention-aware selection mechanism be further refined by incorporating other metrics or heuristics to enhance its effectiveness in identifying and filtering hallucinatory responses?  |
| WorldSimBench: Towards Video Generation Models as World Simulators (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18072) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18072))| XihuiLiu, JeremyYin, LIJUNLI, Zhoues, CoachXP | This research aims to evaluate video generation models as "World Simulators," capable of generating actionable, embodied video. The authors propose WorldSimBench, a dual evaluation framework comprising Explicit Perceptual Evaluation (using a Human Preference Evaluator trained on a novel HF-Embodied dataset with human feedback) and Implicit Manipulative Evaluation (assessing video-action consistency in simulated environments).  Results show the Human Preference Evaluator surpasses GPT-40 in alignment with human preferences, achieving 89.4% accuracy in Open-Ended Embodied Environments. This implies that using human feedback to train evaluators is more effective for assessing video quality in embodied scenarios than zero-shot GPT-40 evaluations. The key takeaway for AI practitioners is that while current video generation models show some promise in generating realistic and controllable video, they still struggle to consistently represent complex physical rules and embody actions, hindering their practical use as World Simulators.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does the architecture of the Human Preference Evaluator compare to other video quality assessment models, and what are the trade-offs of using a fine-tuned VideoLLM approach? 2.  Could the HF-Embodied dataset, with its fine-grained human feedback, be used to improve video generation models themselves, in addition to training evaluators? 3. What are the specific limitations of the chosen simulation environments (Minecraft, CARLA, CALVIN) and how might these limitations affect the generalizability of the benchmark results to real-world applications?  |
| Scaling Diffusion Language Models via Adaptation from Autoregressive Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17891) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.17891))| Jiacheng Ye, Yizhe Zhang, kiaia, shivamag99, Sansa | This research explores scaling diffusion language models (DLMs) by adapting pre-trained autoregressive language models (AR LMs).  The authors introduce a continual pre-training approach involving attention mask annealing and a shift operation to bridge the gap between AR and diffusion modeling objectives.  Their adapted DLMs, DiffuGPT and DiffuLLaMA (scaled up to 7B parameters), outperform prior DLMs on language modeling, reasoning, and infilling tasks, with DiffuGPT-S achieving 50.2% accuracy on GSM8K after fine-tuning.  This implies that adapting existing AR LMs is a viable method for developing competitive DLMs. AI practitioners can utilize this adaptation method to build more efficient and effective DLMs for various tasks, particularly those requiring infilling and global reasoning, without extensive training from scratch.   Follow-up questions:  1.  What are the computational resource requirements and training times for adapting larger AR LMs (e.g., >10B parameters) into DLMs using this method? 2.  How does the choice of pre-training corpus (e.g., FineWeb vs. SlimPajama) affect the performance of the adapted DLMs on specific downstream tasks? 3.  Could incorporating other techniques from AR LMs, like reinforcement learning with human feedback, further enhance the performance of adapted DLMs, especially for tasks like instruction following and code generation?  |
| Lightweight Neural App Control (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17883) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.17883))| Jianye Hao, ShaoKun-HW, Fahren24, gpap, semitable | This research aims to develop a lightweight, efficient mobile phone control architecture for cross-app interaction.  The proposed LiMAC architecture combines a small Action Transformer (AcT) with a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM), processing screenshots, UI trees, and text instructions to generate actions.  LiMAC achieved up to 19% higher action accuracy compared to fine-tuned VLMs and up to 42% higher accuracy than prompt engineering baselines on two mobile control datasets. This implies AI practitioners can develop more accurate and resource-efficient mobile app agents using a gated architecture approach rather than relying solely on large foundation models. The paper is unclear on the exact size (parameter count) of AcT.  Follow-up questions:  1.  What are the specific implementation details and computational requirements of deploying the AcT + VLM architecture on resource-constrained mobile devices? 2.  How does the performance of LiMAC compare with other lightweight models or techniques specifically designed for on-device inference, beyond those mentioned in the paper? 3.  Could the contrastive learning approach used for click target prediction be extended or generalized to other types of action specifications beyond UI element selection?  |
| Scalable Ranked Preference Optimization for Text-to-Image Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18013) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18013))| Sergey Tulyakov, Zeynep Akata, anilkagak2, hcoskun, shyamgopal | This research aims to develop a scalable and cost-effective method for aligning text-to-image (T2I) models with human preferences. The authors introduce a synthetically labeled preference dataset (Syn-Pic) created by ranking images generated from multiple T2I models using pre-trained reward models and a ranking-based preference optimization method (RankDPO) leveraging this dataset.  Results on DPG-Bench show RankDPO improves the DSG score for SDXL from 74.65 to 79.26. This implies AI practitioners can efficiently fine-tune T2I models for improved prompt following and visual quality without expensive human annotation.  The paper doesn't explicitly compare the computational cost of RankDPO with other DPO methods, only with reward optimization methods.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does the diversity of the T2I models used to generate Syn-Pic impact the performance of RankDPO on downstream tasks, and what is the optimal number or combination of models? 2. How robust is RankDPO to the choice of pre-trained reward models used for creating Syn-Pic, and does using a larger ensemble of reward models always lead to better performance? 3. How does the performance of RankDPO, in terms of both effectiveness and computational cost, compare to other DPO variants applied to text-to-image generation, when using the same evaluation metrics and datasets?  |
| DynamicCity: Large-Scale LiDAR Generation from Dynamic Scenes (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18084) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18084))| Yu Qiao, Liang Pan, Haozhe Xie, Lingdong Kong, Hengwei Bian | a) The research aims to develop a framework for generating large-scale, dynamic 4D LiDAR scenes capturing the temporal evolution of environments.  b) DynamicCity uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn a compact 4D representation called HexPlane, and a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to generate novel HexPlanes, which are then decoded into 4D LiDAR scenes. A novel Projection Module and Expansion & Squeeze Strategy are introduced for enhanced VAE performance, and a Padded Rollout Operation prepares HexPlane features for DiT training.  c) DynamicCity outperforms existing methods on CarlaSC and Waymo datasets in 4D scene reconstruction and generation tasks. For example, on CarlaSC, DynamicCity achieved a 38.6% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) for 4D scene reconstruction compared to OccSora when using 16 frames as input.  d) AI practitioners, specifically those working in autonomous driving and robotics, can leverage DynamicCity to generate synthetic 4D LiDAR data for training and testing perception systems, supplementing or replacing expensive and time-consuming real-world data collection. The ability to generate diverse and dynamic scenes, including rare edge cases, can lead to the development of more robust and safe autonomous systems.  Follow-up questions:  1. What are the computational requirements for training and deploying DynamicCity, and how scalable is it to even larger datasets and longer sequence lengths?  2. The paper mentions known limitations related to highly congested scenes.  Could you elaborate on the specific challenges encountered and potential strategies for mitigating these issues in future work?  3. What is the impact of different choices for the diffusion scheduler on the quality and diversity of the generated 4D LiDAR scenes?  |
| ARKit LabelMaker: A New Scale for Indoor 3D Scene Understanding (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13924) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.13924))| Hermann Blum, Marc Pollefeys, Francis Engelmann, Silvan Weder, Guangda Ji | This research investigates whether large-scale pre-training with automatically generated labels benefits 3D semantic segmentation similar to language and image generation tasks.  The authors generated ARKit LabelMaker, a large-scale, real-world 3D dataset with dense semantic annotations by supplementing the ARKitScenes dataset with automatically generated labels using an enhanced LabelMaker pipeline.  Pre-training PointTransformerV3 on this dataset achieved 81.2% mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) on the ScanNet validation set, exceeding vanilla training (77.5% mIoU) and comparable to multi-dataset joint training. This indicates the value of large-scale, real-world data for 3D semantic segmentation, even with imperfect labels.  AI practitioners can leverage this dataset and the improved LabelMakerV2 pipeline for pre-training and potentially improve performance on downstream 3D scene understanding tasks.  Follow-up questions:  1.  How does the performance of models pre-trained on ARKit LabelMaker compare to those pre-trained on synthetic datasets of similar or larger scale, specifically regarding generalization to diverse real-world scenarios? 2.  The paper mentions limitations due to computational cost for certain parts of LabelMaker and missing pose data in some ARKitScenes. How significantly do these limitations impact the overall quality and usability of the generated dataset for pre-training?  3.  What are the specific details of the enhancements made to the LabelMaker pipeline in LabelMakerV2, and how do these improvements contribute to the scalability and robustness of the automatic labeling process?  |
| MedINST: Meta Dataset of Biomedical Instructions (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13458) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.13458))| Zirui Song, Yu Yin, Zihan Zhang, Meng Fang, Wenhan Han | a) This research aimed to address the challenge of limited biomedical instruction datasets for training large language models (LLMs) by creating a comprehensive resource and benchmark.  b) The researchers created MEDINST, a meta-dataset of 133 biomedical natural language processing (NLP) tasks and over 7 million training samples, and MEDINST32, a benchmark subset of 32 tasks with varying difficulty levels, to evaluate LLM generalization.  Several LLMs, including LLaMA-3 variants, were fine-tuned on MEDINST and evaluated on MEDINST32.  c)  LLaMA-3 fine-tuned on MEDINST (LLaMA3-MI) outperformed GPT-40 on 25 out of 32 tasks in MEDINST32.  d) This suggests that using a comprehensive instruction dataset like MEDINST for fine-tuning significantly improves the performance of LLMs on biomedical tasks, even surpassing specialized models like BioMistral, offering practitioners a powerful resource for developing robust biomedical LLMs.  Follow-up questions:  1.  What specific prompting strategies were used during the few-shot evaluation of baseline models and zero-shot evaluation of fine-tuned models, and how did these choices affect performance?  2.  Given the observed performance degradation in summarization and event extraction with increased training data size, attributed to data imbalance, what data augmentation or balancing techniques could be explored to mitigate this issue and improve performance on these tasks?  3.  Could the authors provide further details on the annotation process for the human-annotated instructions, including inter-annotator agreement and quality control measures, to ensure the consistency and reliability of the MEDINST dataset?  |
| M-RewardBench: Evaluating Reward Models in Multilingual Settings (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15522) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.15522))| Drishti Sharma, Rishabh Maheshwary, Lester James V. Miranda, shayekh, srishti-hf1110 | This research investigates the performance of reward models (RMs) in multilingual settings.  The authors created M-REWARDBENCH, a multilingual dataset with 2.87k preference instances across 23 languages and tasks including chat, safety, reasoning, and translation. Evaluation of 25 RMs on M-REWARDBENCH revealed a performance gap between English and non-English languages, with an average drop of over 8% for Classifier and Implicit RMs compared to their performance on the English-centric RewardBench. Generative RMs exhibited the smallest average performance drop at 3%. This implies that AI practitioners should prioritize evaluating and potentially adapting RMs for diverse languages to ensure consistent performance across global user bases.  Follow-up questions:  1.  How does the performance gap observed in M-REWARDBENCH translate to downstream performance of policy models fine-tuned with these RMs in different languages? 2.  The paper mentions filtering English-centric prompts. What specific criteria were used for this filtering, and how might these criteria be adapted for other languages beyond those in M-REWARDBENCH? 3.  Beyond the linguistic dimensions explored, what other cultural factors might influence RM preferences, and how can these be incorporated into future multilingual benchmark development?  |
| TP-Eval: Tap Multimodal LLMs' Potential in Evaluation by Customizing Prompts (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18071) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.18071))| Tianhua Li, Yuxuan Xie, kpzhang, wqshao126 | a) This paper investigates the problem of prompt sensitivity in Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) evaluation, where minor prompt variations can lead to significant performance fluctuations, and proposes a new evaluation framework to mitigate this.  b) The proposed framework, TP-Eval, uses an automatic prompt customization method employing an optimizer-scorer architecture with GPT-40 mini as an optimizer and the evaluated MLLM as a scorer, iteratively generating and evaluating prompts based on accuracy and semantic similarity to the original prompt.  Error introspection from incorrect responses is also incorporated into the optimization process.  c)  On the MMT-S benchmark (a subset of MMT-Bench), LLaVA-1.5-7B achieved a 25.1% average performance improvement across 32 tasks after prompt customization using TP-Eval.  d) AI practitioners evaluating MLLMs should consider prompt customization techniques like TP-Eval to mitigate underestimation caused by prompt sensitivity and obtain a more accurate assessment of model capabilities. The impactful finding is the significant performance improvement achieved by tailoring prompts to individual MLLMs, suggesting current evaluation methods may not fully reveal models' potential.  Follow-up questions:  1. How does TP-Eval's performance compare to other prompt engineering techniques, specifically those designed for few-shot scenarios in multimodal settings? 2. How does the computational cost of running TP-Eval's prompt optimization process scale with the size of the evaluation dataset and the complexity of the MLLM? 3. What are the limitations of relying on GPT-40 mini as the optimizer, and how could these limitations affect the optimization results for different MLLMs?  |

| Large Language Models Orchestrating Structured Reasoning Achieve Kaggle Grandmaster Level (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03562) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.03562))| Albert Thomas, Giuseppe Paolo, James Doran, Alexandre Maraval, Antoine Grosnit | Agent K v1.0, an autonomous data science agent, automates and optimizes the data science lifecycle using structured reasoning and experiential learning. The research aimed to develop an end-to-end autonomous agent capable of achieving high performance on diverse data science tasks.  The agent employs a structured reasoning framework with a memory module, interacting with various tools like Bayesian optimization and pre-trained models from Torchvision and HuggingFace.  Agent K v1.0 achieved a 92.5% success rate in automating Kaggle competition tasks across multiple modalities and ranked in the top 38% of 5,856 human competitors based on Elo-MMR scores.  AI practitioners can leverage Agent K v1.0's approach to automate and improve performance across diverse data science tasks, potentially reducing manual effort and enhancing efficiency.  |
| Both Text and Images Leaked! A Systematic Analysis of Multimodal LLM Data Contamination (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03823) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.03823))| Benyou Wang, Lichao Sun, Shunian Chen, Sicheng Lai, Dingjie Song | MM-Detect, a framework for detecting multimodal data contamination in Large Language Models (LLMs), is introduced.  The research aims to analyze and detect data contamination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).  The framework employs two methods: Option Order Sensitivity Test for multiple-choice VQA and Slot Guessing for Perturbation Captions for caption-based VQA, alongside metrics evaluating performance changes after applying these perturbations.  Experiments on eleven MLLMs across five VQA datasets revealed that incorporating contaminated ScienceQA training data during LLaVA-1.5-7B training increased average CR by 8.2% and PCR by 3.7%.  This indicates that data contamination is prevalent in both open-source and proprietary MLLMs, impacting performance evaluation and potentially creating unfair comparisons, and thus should be considered by practitioners when developing and benchmarking MLLMs.  |

| Interleaved Scene Graph for Interleaved Text-and-Image Generation Assessment (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17188) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.17188))| ranjaykrishna, Tim666, lzy8465, Dipsy0830, shuaishuaicdp | This paper introduces ISG, a framework for evaluating interleaved text-and-image generation.  The research aims to address the lack of robust evaluation metrics for models generating interleaved text and images.  The ISG framework uses a scene graph representation and a four-level (holistic, structural, block, image) evaluation protocol leveraging question-answering feedback.  Compositional models achieved a higher holistic score of 6.262 compared to 2.961 for the best unified model, though still lagging behind human performance. AI practitioners developing multimodal generative models should consider compositional architectures and the fine-grained insights provided by ISG for improving model performance and addressing limitations like instruction following and consistency across modalities.  |

A novel sampling strategy is employed to generate nearly-consistent multi-view videos beyond the model's native output length.  iv)  The model achieves competitive performance on novel view synthesis and dynamic scene reconstruction benchmarks, demonstrating disentangled camera and time control (quantitative result:  21.97 PSNR, 0.683 SSIM, 0.121 LPIPS on disentangled control experiments using NSFF dataset).  v) The  disentangled camera and time control demonstrated by the model is a significant achievement for dynamic scene generation from limited input. This approach directly benefits AI practitioners working on video generation, 3D reconstruction, and augmented/virtual reality applications by providing a more robust method for creating dynamic 3D content from readily available monocular video data.  The paper notes some ambiguity on the robustness of the method when dealing with highly dynamic scenes, implying a need for further research in that area.  |

| SageAttention2 Technical Report: Accurate 4 Bit Attention for Plug-and-play Inference Acceleration (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10958) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.10958))| Jun Zhu, Jia Wei, Pengle Zhang, Haofeng Huang, jt-zhang | SageAttention2 accelerates attention computation in transformer models using 4-bit quantization. The objective is to improve the efficiency of attention computation, particularly for long sequences, while maintaining accuracy comparable to full-precision attention. The key methodology involves quantizing Q and K matrices to INT4 using a per-warp granularity, P and V matrices to FP8 with per-channel granularity for V, and employing smoothing techniques for Q, K, and V to minimize quantization error. SageAttention2 achieves a peak performance of 485 TOPS on RTX4090, surpassing FlashAttention2 by about 3x. AI practitioners can use SageAttention2 as a plug-and-play module to significantly accelerate inference in various transformer-based models, including those for large language processing, image generation, and video generation, with negligible end-to-end metric loss.  |
| VBench++: Comprehensive and Versatile Benchmark Suite for Video Generative Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13503) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.13503))| Jiashuo Yu, Yinan He, Xiaojie Xu, Fan Zhang, Ziqi Huang | VBench++ is a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) generative models.  The research aimed to create a more effective and human-aligned evaluation framework for video generation models than existing metrics.  The methodology involved designing a suite of 16 evaluation dimensions covering video quality, condition consistency, and trustworthiness, along with tailored prompts and evaluation methods, and collecting human preference annotations.  VBench++ evaluations showed a high Spearman's correlation with human preferences (e.g., œÅ = 0.9651 for Subject Consistency).  AI practitioners can use VBench++ to gain detailed insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different video generation models across various dimensions, enabling more informed model selection, training, and development for specific applications.  |
| VideoAutoArena: An Automated Arena for Evaluating Large Multimodal Models in Video Analysis through User Simulation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13281) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.13281))| Mohan Kankanhalli, Jing Ma, Dongxu Li, teowu, Ziyang | VideoAutoArena automates the evaluation of large multimodal models (LMMs) for video analysis using simulated users.  The research aimed to develop a more scalable and user-centric evaluation method for LMMs compared to traditional benchmarks.  The key methodology involves using LMMs to simulate user personas, generate open-ended questions about videos, conduct pairwise model comparisons (battles), automatically judge responses using GPT-40, and rank models using an ELO rating system.  GPT-40 achieved 87.29% agreement with human judges in selecting the better response.  This automated arena provides AI practitioners with a cost-effective and scalable method for evaluating and comparing LMMs in user-centric video analysis tasks.  |
| Is Your LLM Secretly a World Model of the Internet? Model-Based Planning for Web Agents (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06559) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.06559))| Cheng Chang, Kai Zhang, Boyu Gou, Boyuan Zheng, Yu Gu | WEB-DREAMER uses LLMs as world models for planning in web navigation.  The research investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can function as effective world models for web navigation, addressing safety and complexity challenges.  The study uses a model-based planning approach where an LLM simulates potential action outcomes in natural language and selects the highest-scoring action.  On VisualWebArena, WEB-DREAMER achieved a 23.6% success rate, a 33.3% relative improvement over the reactive baseline.  This suggests that incorporating LLM-based world models enables safer and more efficient planning for web agents compared to reactive agents and potentially opens new possibilities for online planning in place of less scalable tree search methods.  |
| SAMURAI: Adapting Segment Anything Model for Zero-Shot Visual Tracking with Motion-Aware Memory (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11922) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.11922))| Jenq-Neng Hwang, Hsiang-Wei Huang, Cheng-Yen Yang, Nitre, wchai | SAMURAI enhances the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) for zero-shot visual object tracking.  The research aims to improve SAM 2's visual object tracking performance, particularly in crowded scenes and during occlusions, without retraining or fine-tuning.  The key methodology involves integrating motion information via a Kalman Filter and a motion-aware memory selection mechanism to improve mask selection and memory management within the SAM 2 architecture.  SAMURAI achieves a 7.1% AUC gain on the LaSOText dataset and a 3.5% AO gain on GOT-10k compared to the baseline SAM2.1.  This improvement offers AI practitioners a more robust and accurate real-time, zero-shot visual tracking method readily adaptable across various datasets and potentially other tracking frameworks.  |
| Stylecodes: Encoding Stylistic Information For Image Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12811) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.12811))| CiaraRowles | Stylecodes encodes image styles into compact strings for style-conditioned image generation.  The research aimed to develop an open-source method for controlling the style of diffusion-based image generation, enabling easy sharing and collaboration.  The authors developed Stylecodes, a system combining an attention-based autoencoder and a ControlNet-style UNet decoder to encode image style as a 20-digit base64 code and condition a frozen Stable Diffusion 1.5 model.  Experiments showed that Stylecodes effectively enforces the encoded style, allowing generation of images matching the style of a source image given different text prompts; the dataset size was 35,000 image-style-prompt entries.  AI practitioners can use Stylecodes for easily shareable and collaborative style control in image generation, though the paper does not specify the quality of style transfer compared to other methods nor specify metrics for evaluation.  The training cost for the control model was a limitation, especially for larger diffusion models.  |
| When Precision Meets Position: BFloat16 Breaks Down RoPE in Long-Context Training (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13476) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.13476))| Cunxiao Du, Tongyao Zhu, Chao Du, Qian Liu, haonan3 | This paper investigates the impact of BFloat16 precision on Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) in long-context language model training.  The authors aim to determine if BFloat16 precision degrades the relative positional encoding properties of RoPE and how this affects long-context performance.  They introduce AnchorAttention, a modified attention mechanism that treats the first token as a shared anchor with a fixed position ID, and compare its performance to full attention and intra-document attention. Results on the RULER benchmark show AnchorAttention significantly improves long-context performance, exceeding full attention by 17.47 percentage points on the LLAMA-2-7B model with 128K context window. AI practitioners training LLMs with long contexts should consider using AnchorAttention with BFloat16 to improve performance and reduce training time.  |
| ORID: Organ-Regional Information Driven Framework for Radiology Report Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13025) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.13025))| Dongnan Liu, Ziyong Feng, Xiang An, Tiancheng Gu, Kaichengalex | The paper introduces ORID, a framework for generating radiology reports from X-ray images by leveraging organ-regional information.  The objective is to improve the accuracy and believability of automated radiology report generation.  ORID uses a LLaVA-Med-RRG model fine-tuned on an organ-level instruction dataset, an organ-based cross-modal fusion module, and an organ importance coefficient analysis module based on a graph neural network. On the IU-Xray dataset, ORID achieved a BLEU@1 score of 0.501, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. This implies that AI practitioners working on medical report generation can leverage organ-specific information and cross-modal fusion techniques to enhance the precision and clinical relevance of generated reports.  |

| LongLLaVA: Scaling Multi-modal LLMs to 1000 Images Efficiently via Hybrid Architecture | Benyou Wang, Chen Zhang, Shunian Chen, Xidong Wang, songdj | The paper introduces LongLLaVA, a novel hybrid multi-modal large language model (MLLM) designed for efficient long-context understanding. By integrating Mamba and Transformer blocks, LongLLaVA effectively handles temporal and spatial dependencies among multiple images, achieving competitive performance on benchmarks like MileBench and Video-MME. Notably, LongLLaVA requires significantly fewer FLOPs compared to other models while demonstrating strong in-context learning capabilities. This efficiency and performance make LongLLaVA a valuable tool for AI practitioners, particularly in applications involving video understanding, high-resolution image processing, and multi-modal agents.   | [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02889) |
| Loopy: Taming Audio-Driven Portrait Avatar with Long-Term Motion Dependency | Gaojie Lin, Jiaqi Yang, Chao Liang, tianyumyum, janphu | This paper introduces LOOPY, an end-to-end audio-driven portrait video generation framework that generates realistic talking head videos solely from audio input, eliminating the reliance on spatial motion templates used in previous methods.  LOOPY leverages inter- and intra-clip temporal modules to model long-term motion dependencies and an audio-to-motion latents module for effective audio-portrait motion correlation. Experiments on diverse datasets, including CelebV-HQ and RAVDESS, demonstrate LOOPY's superior performance in generating temporally stable, expressive, and high-quality talking head videos, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. Practitioners, including AI engineers and data scientists, can utilize LOOPY to develop robust and realistic talking head generation systems for various applications, such as virtual assistants, video conferencing, and entertainment.  The removal of spatial constraints and the ability to learn natural motion patterns from audio make LOOPY a significant advancement in audio-driven video synthesis.   | [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02634) |
| LongCite: Enabling LLMs to Generate Fine-grained Citations in Long-context QA | LZDQ, Broccolito, davidlvxin, bys0318, NeoZ123 | This research paper introduces LongCite, a system designed to enhance the trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling them to provide fine-grained citations within their long-form answers.  The authors identify the limitations of current LLMs in providing adequate citations for long-context question answering (LQAC) and propose a novel pipeline called CoF (Coarse to Fine) to automatically construct a large-scale LQAC dataset, LongCite-45k. By fine-tuning existing open-source long-context models on this dataset, they demonstrate significant improvements in citation quality, even surpassing proprietary models like GPT-40. This advancement holds practical significance for AI practitioners, particularly AI engineers and data scientists, by equipping LLMs with enhanced transparency and verifiability, making them more reliable for various applications.   | [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02897) |
| MMMU-Pro: A More Robust Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding Benchmark | btyu, jamessyx, yuanshengni, aaabiao, yuexiang96 | The research paper introduces MMMU-Pro, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the multimodal reasoning capabilities of large language models. MMMU-Pro addresses limitations in existing benchmarks by incorporating three key enhancements: filtering out questions solvable by text-only models, augmenting candidate options to mitigate guessing, and introducing a vision-only input setting to assess genuine multimodal understanding.  Experimental results demonstrate significant performance drops across a variety of state-of-the-art multimodal models, indicating that MMMU-Pro poses a more realistic challenge. This benchmark provides AI practitioners, including AI engineers and data scientists, with a valuable tool for assessing and improving the robustness and reliability of multimodal systems, particularly in real-world scenarios where text and images are intertwined.   | [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02813) |
| Arctic-SnowCoder: Demystifying High-Quality Data in Code Pretraining | rajhans-snowflake, stovecat, yuxiang630 | Arctic-SnowCoder-1.3B is a new, high-performing code language model trained on 555B tokens utilizing a novel three-step methodology of progressively refined data quality. This model outperforms StarCoderBase-3B on all benchmarks despite being trained with significantly less data and achieves state-of-the-art results on BigCodeBench compared to similarly sized models.  The authors demonstrate that aligning training data distribution with downstream tasks is crucial for effective code pretraining and significantly enhances model performance.  These findings and the model itself will be of significant interest to practitioners, especially AI engineers who develop code generation and program synthesis applications.   | [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02326) |
| Political DEBATE: Efficient Zero-shot and Few-shot Classifiers for Political Text | Rachel X. Peng, Ryan Yank Wang, Michael Burnham, kaylakahn | This paper introduces Political DEBATE, a pair of open-source language models specifically designed for efficient zero-shot and few-shot classification of political text. Trained on the novel PolNLI dataset, comprising over 200,000 political documents and 852 unique hypotheses, the models exhibit superior performance compared to existing open-source alternatives across tasks such as stance detection, topic classification, hate-speech identification, and event extraction.  The authors demonstrate that with minimal few-shot training (10-25 documents), Political DEBATE achieves comparable or even better accuracy than supervised classifiers and resource-intensive generative LLMs. The availability of these efficient and open-source models presents a valuable resource for practitioners in political science and related fields, enabling accessible and reproducible text analysis.   | [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02078) |
| FastVoiceGrad: One-step Diffusion-Based Voice Conversion with Adversarial Conditional Diffusion Distillation | Yuto Kondo, Hirokazu Kameoka, Takuhiro Kaneko, ououo | This research introduces FastVoiceGrad, a novel one-step diffusion-based voice conversion (VC) model that addresses the slow inference limitation of multi-step diffusion-based VC methods. FastVoiceGrad leverages adversarial conditional diffusion distillation (ACDD), which distills knowledge from a pretrained multi-step teacher diffusion model into a one-step student model using adversarial loss and score distillation loss. Experimental results demonstrate that FastVoiceGrad achieves comparable performance to multi-step models while significantly reducing computational cost, achieving a real-time factor of 0.060 for mel-spectrogram conversion. This development provides AI practitioners, particularly those working on VC applications, a faster and computationally efficient alternative for real-time and resource-constrained scenarios.   | [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02245) |
| Affordance-based Robot Manipulation with Flow Matching | Michael Gienger, Fanzhri | This research paper introduces a novel framework for robot manipulation that leverages prompt tuning and flow matching. The authors propose a parameter-efficient prompt tuning method to adapt pre-trained vision models for affordance learning conditioned on language instructions. They then introduce a flow matching policy, a generative approach that learns to transform random waypoints into desired robot trajectories guided by visual affordances. Experimental results on a constructed real-world dataset of Activities of Daily Living demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive performance in both affordance learning and trajectory generation compared to existing methods. This work presents a promising direction for AI practitioners working on robot manipulation, particularly in scenarios where data efficiency and generalization to multi-task settings are crucial. The integration of prompt tuning facilitates efficient adaptation of large pre-trained models, while the flow matching policy offers a stable and effective approach for generating robot trajectories from visual affordances.   | [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01083) |

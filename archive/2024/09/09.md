| How Do Your Code LLMs Perform? Empowering Code Instruction Tuning with High-Quality Data - read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03810) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.03810) | mdizhang, bitwjg, dongguanting, fudayuan, banksy235 | The authors propose XCoder, a family of large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned from LLaMA3 using a novel data selection strategy for code instruction tuning. Recognizing the limitations of existing code instruction datasets, often plagued by data leakage and inconsistent quality, the authors introduce a three-pronged data assessment approach.  This approach prioritizes instruction complexity, response quality (evaluated through a unit test model), and instruction diversity to curate a high-quality training dataset.  Experimental results demonstrate that XCoder surpasses or matches state-of-the-art open-source code LLMs on benchmarks like HumanEval and LiveCodeBench, even with significantly fewer training samples.  This research offers AI practitioners valuable insights into constructing and leveraging high-quality code instruction datasets for enhanced code generation and understanding.   |
| Configurable Foundation Models: Building LLMs from a Modular Perspective - read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02877) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.02877) | fengyao1909, thuzhizhi, Raincleared, ZhengyanZhang, xcjthu | This research paper proposes the novel concept of "configurable foundation models," which are built upon modular components termed "bricks," offering a modular perspective on large language model (LLM) construction and deployment. The paper categorizes bricks as either "emergent," arising from the pre-training process, or "customized," manually designed for specific post-training tasks, and outlines four key brick-oriented operations: routing and retrieval, combination, updating, and growing. Empirical analysis on decoder-only models, Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, reveals sparse neuron activation, functionality specialization, and potential for modular partitioning. These findings hold significant implications for AI practitioners, suggesting that LLM efficiency and scalability can be improved by leveraging modularity through selective brick activation, facilitating continual learning, and enabling distributed computation.   |
| Open-MAGVIT2: An Open-Source Project Toward Democratizing Auto-regressive Visual Generation - read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04410) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.04410) | Yujiu Yang, yshan2u, yxgeee, shifengyuan, RobertLuo1 | This research paper introduces Open-MAGVIT2, an open-source family of auto-regressive image generation models. The authors replicate Google's MAGVIT-v2 tokenizer, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction performance on ImageNet by utilizing a super-large codebook with lookup-free quantization. To address the challenges of auto-regressive prediction with such a large vocabulary, they propose "next sub-token prediction" with asymmetric token factorization, improving generation quality.  Open-MAGVIT2 demonstrates superior performance in both visual reconstruction and class-conditional generation using a plain auto-regressive approach. The release of these models and code provides AI practitioners with a powerful toolset for advancing auto-regressive visual generation, particularly within unified multimodal frameworks.   |
| Qihoo-T2X: An Efficiency-Focused Diffusion Transformer via Proxy Tokens for Text-to-Any-Task - read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04005) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.04005) | Yuhui Yin, Dawei Leng, Jiasong Feng, Jing Wang, AoMa | This research paper introduces PT-DiT, a novel Proxy Token Diffusion Transformer designed for computationally efficient text-to-image and text-to-video generation tasks. PT-DiT leverages the redundancy in visual information by utilizing a sparse proxy token attention mechanism, wherein a select set of representative tokens, sampled based on spatio-temporal priors, model global visual relationships. To further enhance texture detail, the model incorporates window attention and shift-window attention modules. Experimental results demonstrate that PT-DiT achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing computational complexity and memory usage, making it particularly beneficial for high-resolution image and video generation. This efficiency gain makes PT-DiT and the Qihoo-T2X family of models valuable tools for AI practitioners, particularly AI engineers and data scientists working on resource-intensive generative tasks.   |
| GST: Precise 3D Human Body from a Single Image with Gaussian Splatting Transformers - read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04196) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.04196) | Christian Rupprecht, Joao F. Henriques, Lorenza Prospero, ajhamdi | The paper introduces Gaussian Splatting Transformers (GST), a novel method for reconstructing 3D human models from monocular images using Gaussian Splatting representations. GST leverages a transformer architecture trained solely on multi-view supervision, eliminating the need for expensive 3D annotations or diffusion priors. Experiments demonstrate that GST achieves competitive performance on 3D human pose estimation and novel view synthesis tasks. This efficient and accurate approach holds significant potential for practitioners in various domains, including virtual reality, augmented reality, and human-computer interaction, by enabling real-time 3D human modeling from readily available data sources.   |

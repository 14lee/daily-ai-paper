| Phantom of Latent for Large Language and Vision Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14713) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.14713))| Yong Man Ro, Beomchan Park, Sangyun Chung, chae-won-kim, BK-Lee | The paper introduces Phantom, an efficient family of large language and vision models (LLVMs) that enhances learning capabilities within limited model sizes. Phantom temporarily increases the latent hidden dimension during multi-head self-attention (MHSA), allowing it to embed more vision-language knowledge without significantly increasing physical model size. The authors also introduce Phantom Optimization (PO), a novel training strategy inspired by Direct Preference Optimization, which guides the model towards correct answers while minimizing incorrect and ambiguous ones. Experiments demonstrate that Phantom outperforms numerous larger open- and closed-source LLVMs across various vision-language benchmarks. This is highly relevant to practitioners, particularly AI engineers and data scientists, who seek to develop and deploy efficient yet high-performing LLVMs for resource-constrained environments, such as mobile devices and embedded systems. By demonstrating the effectiveness of latent space optimization in enhancing LLVMs, the paper provides valuable insights for designing and training future efficient multimodal models.   |

| MaterialFusion: Enhancing Inverse Rendering with Material Diffusion Priors (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15273) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.15273))| Rushikesh Zawar, Aviral Agrawal, Kangle Deng, Or Patashnik, Yehonathan Litman | The paper introduces MaterialFusion, a novel inverse rendering approach that leverages a 2D material diffusion prior, called StableMaterial, to enhance the reconstruction of an object's 3D representation, including geometry, materials, and illumination, from a set of multi-view images. StableMaterial is trained on a vast dataset of synthetic objects with high-quality Physically Based Rendering (PBR) assets, enabling it to learn a prior over plausible material and albedo combinations. Experimental results demonstrate that MaterialFusion surpasses state-of-the-art inverse rendering methods in reconstructing faithful material properties and accurately relighting objects under novel illumination conditions. This work holds significant implications for practitioners in computer graphics and vision, including AI engineers and data scientists, by providing a robust method for 3D object reconstruction and relighting, which can be applied in various domains like virtual reality, augmented reality, and content creation.   |
| Zero-shot Cross-lingual Voice Transfer for TTS (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13910) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.13910))| Gary Wang, Kyle Kastner, Isaac Elias, Youzheng Chen, Fadi Biadsy | This paper introduces a novel zero-shot voice transfer (VT) module for multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) systems, capable of transferring an individual's voice across languages using a single short reference utterance.  The module comprises a speaker encoder, a bottleneck layer (with SegmentGST shown most effective for typical speech), and residual adapters integrated into a pre-existing TTS system.  Evaluations demonstrate an average voice transfer similarity score of 73% across nine languages, even with atypical reference speech.  This research is highly relevant for AI practitioners developing accessible TTS systems or voice restoration technologies, enabling high-quality, cross-lingual voice transfer and offering potential benefits to individuals with speech impairments.   |
| MaskedMimic: Unified Physics-Based Character Control Through Masked Motion Inpainting (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14393) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.14393))| Xue Bin Peng, Ofir Nabati, Yunrong Guo, Chen Tessler, galchechik | The research paper, "MaskedMimic: Unified Physics-Based Character Control Through Masked Motion Inpainting," introduces a novel framework for controlling physically simulated humanoid characters by leveraging a motion inpainting approach.  MaskedMimic is trained on a diverse dataset of motion capture data with various modalities, including joint positions, text descriptions, and object interactions, where portions of the input data are strategically masked out. This forces the model to learn a general understanding of generating realistic and diverse human motions from partial information.  The authors demonstrate that a single unified control architecture trained with this approach can successfully perform various tasks like locomotion, object interaction, VR tracking, and even text-to-motion synthesis without requiring task-specific training or reward engineering. Practitioners, including AI engineers and data scientists working in character animation and robotics, can benefit from this framework by having a simplified and flexible tool to create versatile and interactive virtual characters.   |
| Self-Supervised Audio-Visual Soundscape Stylization (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14340) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.14340))| Gopala Anumanchipalli, Andrew Owens, Po-Yao Huang, Renhao Wang, Tingle Li | This paper introduces the concept of audio-visual soundscape stylization, a technique to modify input audio to reflect the acoustic and ambient properties of a target scene represented by an audio-visual sample. The authors propose a self-supervised learning framework based on conditional speech de-enhancement using a latent diffusion model trained on unlabeled, in-the-wild videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the model's superiority over existing audio stylization methods in replicating acoustic properties and ambient sounds. This technique holds significant potential for practitioners, such as AI engineers and data scientists, in applications like realistic audio dubbing for videos, generating immersive virtual environments, and enhancing audio quality in old recordings.   |
| A Case Study of Web App Coding with OpenAI Reasoning Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13773) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.13773))| onekq | This paper presents a case study evaluating OpenAI's latest reasoning models (o1-preview and o1-mini) on web application coding tasks. While demonstrating superior performance on the single-task WebApp1K benchmark, the models exhibit significant decline in the harder WebApp1K-Duo benchmark, falling behind Claude 3.5. The authors attribute this variability to instruction comprehension, where the reasoning mechanism, while beneficial with complete expectations, exacerbates errors when key expectations are missed. A key insight for practitioners, such as AI engineers and data scientists, is that the success of reasoning models in coding hinges not only on their reasoning capabilities but also on a robust base model and meticulous adherence to instructions, achieved through methods like SFT.  This highlights the importance of focusing on both reasoning and instruction following when developing and deploying AI models for coding applications.   |

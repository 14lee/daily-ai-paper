| INTRA: Interaction Relationship-aware Weakly Supervised Affordance Grounding (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06210) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.06210))| Se Young Chun, Agorium, jeeit17 | This research paper introduces INTRA, a novel weakly-supervised affordance grounding framework that leverages representation learning and interaction relationship-guided contrastive learning. Unlike previous approaches relying on paired exocentric and egocentric images, INTRA utilizes only exocentric images and incorporates large language models (LLMs) to understand the complex relationship between interactions. INTRA outperforms prior arts on multiple datasets, including AGD20K, IIT-AFF, CAD, and UMD, demonstrating its superior performance and domain scalability. AI practitioners, such as AI engineers and data scientists, can benefit from INTRA's ability to ground affordances for novel objects and interactions, potentially leading to improved robot manipulation and scene understanding in diverse environments. The method's ability to leverage LLMs for enhanced linguistic understanding of interactions offers a new direction for affordance grounding research.   |
| LLaMA-Omni: Seamless Speech Interaction with Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06666) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.06666))| zhangshaolei, Paulmzr, zysgdd, guoshoutao, poeroz | This research paper introduces LLaMA-Omni, a novel model architecture for low-latency, high-quality speech interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs). LLaMA-Omni leverages a speech encoder, a speech adapter, an LLM, and a streaming speech decoder to directly process speech instructions and generate text and speech responses with minimal latency. The researchers also created a new speech instruction dataset, InstructS2S-200K, to train and evaluate the model. Experimental results demonstrate that LLaMA-Omni outperforms existing speech-language models in terms of content and style while achieving a low response latency of 226ms. This work is particularly relevant to AI practitioners working on speech-based applications, such as conversational AI and virtual assistants, as it offers an efficient and effective solution for building seamless speech interfaces powered by LLMs.   |
| SongCreator: Lyrics-based Universal Song Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06029) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.06029))| zy001, kangshiyin, jingchengwu, GK50, maxingaussian | The paper proposes SongCreator, a novel lyrics-based universal song generation system capable of generating high-quality songs with both vocals and accompaniment. The system utilizes a dual-sequence language model (DSLM) with a dynamic bidirectional cross-attention module to capture the interplay between vocal and accompaniment sequences. This architecture, trained using a multi-task learning strategy, enables SongCreator to perform various song generation tasks, including lyrics-to-song, vocals-to-song, and song editing, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods in several tasks. The authors highlight the potential of SongCreator to become a powerful tool for content creators and musicians, lowering the barrier of entry for novices while streamlining the workflow for experienced producers. However, they acknowledge the potential risks associated with replicating voices and emphasize the need for responsible development, choosing not to release the fully trained models.   |
| Draw an Audio: Leveraging Multi-Instruction for Video-to-Audio Synthesis (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06135) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.06135))| Pengfei Gao, Xing Nie, Binjie Mao, MarkWang, YannQi | This research paper introduces Draw an Audio, a novel framework for video-to-audio synthesis that utilizes multi-instruction control to address limitations in content consistency, temporal synchronization, and loudness control observed in prior art. The authors leverage masked attention and time-loudness modules to enable granular control over audio generation guided by user-provided masks and loudness signals.  Experimental validation on AudioCaps and VGGSound-Caption datasets demonstrates Draw an Audio's superior performance in generating high-fidelity audio synchronized with video content. This research is highly relevant to practitioners, such as AI engineers and data scientists, working on applications requiring realistic and controllable sound generation from video data, including foley design, video editing, and multimodal content creation.   |
| SaRA: High-Efficient Diffusion Model Fine-tuning with Progressive Sparse Low-Rank Adaptation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06633) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.06633))| Yabiao Wang, Ran Yi, Jiangning Zhang, Teng Hu, hongruihuang | This research paper introduces SaRA, a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique designed to enhance the capabilities of pre-trained diffusion models for downstream tasks. The core of SaRA lies in selectively fine-tuning a subset of parameters with the smallest absolute values in the pre-trained model, exploiting their potential effectiveness. To mitigate overfitting due to the high representation ability of sparse matrices, SaRA employs a nuclear-norm-based low-rank loss, constraining the rank of learned sparse matrices. Furthermore, a progressive parameter adjustment strategy is introduced to enhance the utilization of initially ineffective parameters.  Experimental results across various tasks, including backbone fine-tuning, downstream dataset fine-tuning, image customization, and controllable video generation, demonstrate that SaRA achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art parameter efficient fine-tuning methods, while effectively preserving the model's prior knowledge.  This method is particularly relevant to AI practitioners as it provides an efficient and effective way to adapt pre-trained diffusion models for specific tasks, offering both enhanced performance and reduced memory footprint during training.   |

| Robust Dual Gaussian Splatting for Immersive Human-centric Volumetric Videos (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08353) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.08353))| Yu Hong, Zhehao Shen, Yuheng Jiang, Daluuu, chengchengguo123 | This paper introduces DualGS, a novel Gaussian-based representation for robust human performance tracking and high-fidelity rendering in volumetric videos. The approach utilizes Dual Gaussians to disentangle motion and appearance, employing motion-aware joint Gaussians and appearance-aware skin Gaussians. A coarse-to-fine optimization strategy with motion prediction ensures temporal coherence and rendering fidelity.  A companion compression scheme using residual vector quantization, codec compression, and a persistent codebook achieves a 120-fold compression ratio.  DualGS offers AI practitioners a method for creating high-fidelity, interactive volumetric video experiences that are efficient enough for deployment on VR and mobile devices.   |

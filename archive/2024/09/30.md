| MIO: A Foundation Model on Multimodal Tokens (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17692) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.17692))| Jiaheng Liu, Wangchunshu Zhou, Chunpu Xu, King Zhu, Zekun Wang | MIO aims to develop an any-to-any multimodal foundation model capable of understanding and generating text, images, speech, and video.  The methodology involves training on discrete multimodal tokens using a four-stage process: alignment pre-training, interleaved pre-training, speech-enhanced pre-training, and supervised fine-tuning on various tasks. On the SEED-Bench, MIO-Instruct achieves 54.4% MCQ accuracy. This model offers AI practitioners a unified framework for diverse multimodal tasks, including interleaved video-text generation and chain-of-visual-thought reasoning.  The paper doesn't provide details on the size of the training dataset.   Follow-up Questions:  1. What specific architectures and hyperparameters were used for the different pre-training stages, and how were they determined? 2.  Could you elaborate on the computational resources required for training and inference, and how these scale with model size? 3. What are the limitations of the current video generation capabilities, particularly regarding generating raw video data rather than frame sequences?  |
| VPTQ: Extreme Low-bit Vector Post-Training Quantization for Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17066) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.17066))| Li Lyna Zhang, Shengyu Ye, Jicheng Wen, Yifei Liu, yangwang92 | This paper explores extremely low-bit weight-only quantization for Large Language Models (LLMs) to reduce memory footprint and improve inference speed.  The authors propose Vector Post-Training Quantization (VPTQ), leveraging second-order optimization and channel-independent quantization to minimize the impact of vector quantization on model accuracy.  On LLaMA-2 7B, VPTQ at 2.02 bits achieves a WikiText2 perplexity of 6.13 and an average improvement of 1% on QA tasks compared to previous state-of-the-art.  This method allows for substantial model compression and faster inference speeds without significant accuracy degradation, useful for deploying LLMs on resource-constrained devices. The paper doesn't detail the computational cost of VPTQ compared to other methods like GPTQ aside from quoting inference throughput.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the memory bandwidth requirement of VPTQ during inference compare to GPTQ and other scalar quantization methods, given the need to load codebooks? 2. What is the detailed breakdown of the quantization algorithm execution time (10.4-18.6%) – which steps contribute most significantly, and how can these be further optimized? 3.  The paper mentions layer-wise finetuning. What is the specific process and its impact on final model accuracy and quantization time compared to not finetuning or performing full finetuning?  |
| Modulated Intervention Preference Optimization (MIPO): Keep the Easy, Refine the Difficult (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17545) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.17545))| fetong | This research aimed to improve preference optimization for large language models (LLMs) by addressing the limitations of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The authors proposed Modulated Intervention Preference Optimization (MIPO), which modulates the influence of a reference model during training based on the alignment between the reference model and each preference pair, measured using differences in average log-likelihood. On AlpacaEval 2.0, MIPO achieved a 9.05% higher win-rate than DPO using Llama3-8B-Instruct and an 8.19% higher win-rate using Mistral-7B-Base. This suggests that MIPO can facilitate more effective alignment of LLMs with human preferences compared to DPO by focusing training effort on instances where the reference model needs more improvement.  The paper does not discuss computational complexity differences between MIPO and DPO.   Follow-up questions:  1. How does the computational cost of MIPO compare to DPO, considering the additional computation required to calculate and integrate the modulation factor q(K)? 2. Could the performance gains observed with MIPO on AlpacaEval 2.0 and MT-Bench generalize to other preference optimization tasks and datasets? 3. What are the practical considerations for selecting the hyperparameter β in MIPO, and is there a more principled approach to tuning this parameter beyond the empirical analysis presented?  |
| MSI-Agent: Incorporating Multi-Scale Insight into Embodied Agents for Superior Planning and Decision-Making (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16686) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.16686))| Guanting Dong, Che Jiang, Yihuai Gao, Biqing Qi, Dayuan Fu | a) This research aimed to improve the planning and decision-making abilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-based embodied agents by effectively summarizing and utilizing insights from prior experiences.  b) The researchers developed a Multi-Scale Insight Agent (MSI-Agent) featuring an experience selector, insight generator, and insight selector to organize experiences into multi-scale insights (general, environment, and subtask) and selectively use these insights when prompting the LLM.  c)  MSI-Agent achieved a 12.70% success rate on in-domain data and 14.54% on out-of-domain data on the TEACh Trajectory from Dialogue (TfD) benchmark, outperforming existing baselines, including the HELPER and Expel agents.  d)  This research indicates AI practitioners can significantly enhance LLM-based agent performance in embodied tasks by using multi-scale insight summarization and selection, especially in domain adaptation scenarios.  This is impactful as it provides a practical method for improving the robustness and generalizability of embodied agents across different environments and tasks.  Here are some follow-up questions an AI practitioner might ask:  1. What is the computational overhead of generating and storing multi-scale insights, and how can this be optimized for real-time applications? 2. How does MSI-Agent perform on more complex embodied tasks with longer horizons and more diverse interaction objects? 3.  Can the insights generated by MSI-Agent be transferred or adapted for use with different LLMs or embodied agent architectures?   |

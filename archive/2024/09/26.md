| Programming Every Example: Lifting Pre-training Data Quality like Experts at Scale (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17115) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.17115))| Qian Liu, Pengfei, lockon, SinclairWang, koalazf99 | The paper introduces Programming Every Example (PROX), a novel framework for refining large-scale language model pre-training data by utilizing small language models to generate and execute data processing programs. PROX refines data through a two-stage process: document-level programming for filtering and chunk-level programming for fine-grained operations like string normalization.  Experimental results demonstrate that PROX-curated data consistently enhances model performance, achieving a 2.1% average improvement over 10 downstream benchmarks and surpassing state-of-the-art data selection techniques by over 2.0%.  Furthermore, PROX significantly reduces the required training tokens for comparable performance, offering up to 20x training efficiency improvements in certain domains. Practitioners, including AI engineers and data scientists, can leverage PROX to enhance data quality and significantly reduce training costs for large language models, making LLM development more efficient and accessible.   |
| Molmo and PixMo: Open Weights and Open Data for State-of-the-Art Multimodal Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17146) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.17146))| Muennighoff, SMSD75, jamepark3922, sharpen, mattdeitke | The paper introduces Molmo, a family of open-weight and open-data vision-language models (VLMs) trained on a novel dataset named PixMo.  Unlike previous open VLMs that relied heavily on synthetic data from proprietary systems, Molmo leverages a high-quality dataset of detailed image descriptions collected using a speech-based annotation approach.  Evaluation on 11 academic benchmarks and human evaluation demonstrate that Molmo achieves state-of-the-art performance among open VLMs, even rivaling proprietary models like GPT-40.  The release of Molmo's weights, data, and code provides practitioners and researchers with valuable resources for building and studying performant VLMs from scratch.    |
| Boosting Healthcare LLMs Through Retrieved Context (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15127) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.15127))| Ashwin Kumar Gururajan, dariog, JordiBayarri | This research investigates the enhancement of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) for medical question answering through optimized context retrieval techniques. The authors find that incorporating choice shuffling, an optimal number of ensembles, and enriching databases with Chain-of-Thought augmented examples significantly improves performance on multiple-choice question answering benchmarks, achieving accuracy comparable to private models like MedPalm-2 and GPT-4. They introduce OpenMedPrompt, a novel framework for open-ended medical question answering, with two strategies: Ensemble Refining (OM-ER) and Self-Reflection (OM-SR), demonstrating the effectiveness of iterative feedback and reward model integration. The study provides valuable insights for AI engineers and data scientists working on building accurate and reliable healthcare AI systems by showcasing the potential of open-source LLMs augmented with optimized context retrieval.   |
| DreamWaltz-G: Expressive 3D Gaussian Avatars from Skeleton-Guided 2D Diffusion (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17145) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.17145))| Lei Zhang, Zheng-Jun Zha, Jianan Wang, alkxncda, KevinHuang | The paper introduces DreamWaltz-G, a novel framework for generating animatable 3D avatars from text descriptions. It leverages pretrained 2D diffusion models and a novel Skeleton-guided Score Distillation (SkelSD) technique, enhancing 3D consistency and pose accuracy. DreamWaltz-G utilizes a hybrid 3D Gaussian representation (H3GA), integrating neural implicit fields and parameterized meshes for efficient rendering, optimization, and expressive animation. Experiments demonstrate superior generation and animation quality, outperforming existing methods.  AI practitioners can utilize DreamWaltz-G for applications like character generation in gaming and virtual reality, benefiting from its text-driven approach, realistic animation, and efficient implementation.   |
| Degradation-Guided One-Step Image Super-Resolution with Diffusion Priors (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17058) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.17058))| Renjing Pei, Aiping Zhang, cxc361461518, Akowang, OAOA | The authors present S3Diff, a novel one-step image super-resolution (SR) model that leverages a pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model. By incorporating degradation-guided Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), S3Diff efficiently adapts model parameters based on the degradation characteristics of low-resolution images, enhancing its efficiency and effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate S3Diff's superior performance in both synthetic and real-world scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art results with just one sampling step. This approach holds significant implications for practitioners, particularly AI engineers and data scientists working on image enhancement tasks, by offering a computationally efficient yet highly effective solution for super-resolution. The integration of degradation awareness further enhances the model's practical applicability for real-world image restoration scenarios.  |
| Game4Loc: A UAV Geo-Localization Benchmark from Game Data (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16925) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.16925))| Liaoni Wu, Zhuoyue Tan, heboyong, Yux1ang | This paper introduces Game4Loc, a novel benchmark for UAV geo-localization based on data extracted from commercial video games. Game4Loc addresses the limitations of existing datasets, which primarily rely on perfectly aligned drone-satellite image pairs, by incorporating partial matching scenarios that better reflect real-world conditions. The authors propose weighted-InfoNCE, a contrastive learning approach that leverages intersection-over-union (IOU) as a supervisory signal to improve partial matching performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Game4Loc and the proposed training method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both cross-area and same-area geo-localization tasks. This work provides AI engineers and data scientists with a valuable resource for developing and evaluating more robust and practical UAV geo-localization systems.   |
| AIM 2024 Sparse Neural Rendering Challenge: Dataset and Benchmark (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15041) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.15041))| Radu Timofte, Richard Shaw, sibicatleychandar, thomas-tanay, michaal94 | This research paper introduces SpaRe, a novel dataset and benchmark designed for evaluating sparse-view neural rendering. Existing datasets and protocols are shown to suffer from limitations like low-resolution evaluation and overfitting due to public test data.  SpaRe addresses these issues with high-quality synthetic renderings, hidden test data, and diverse camera viewpoints. Through an online platform, SpaRe allows researchers to benchmark novel view synthesis methods in a standardized manner and contribute to a public leaderboard. Experimental results highlight the strengths and weaknesses of both per-scene optimization and generalizable methods for sparse neural rendering. Practitioners, such as AI engineers and data scientists, can leverage SpaRe to rigorously evaluate and compare the performance of new sparse-view neural rendering algorithms.   |

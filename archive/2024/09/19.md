| LLMs + Persona-Plug = Personalized LLMs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11901) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.11901))| Erxue Min, Xiaochi Wei, stingw, yutaozhu94, liujiongnan | This paper proposes PPlug, a novel personalized Large Language Model (LLM) designed to tailor outputs according to individual user preferences.

| To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic reasoning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.12183))| wadhma, Dongwei, juand-r, fcyin, Zaynes | The research paper "To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic reasoning" by wadhma et al. investigates the effectiveness of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for enhancing large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities. Through meta-analysis of existing literature and empirical evaluations across 20 datasets and 14 contemporary LLMs, the authors demonstrate that CoT provides substantial performance benefits primarily for tasks involving mathematics or formal logic, with minimal gains observed for tasks requiring non-symbolic reasoning. Further analysis reveals that CoT's strength lies in its ability to execute symbolic steps and track intermediate computational outputs.  The authors suggest that while CoT remains a useful technique, practitioners, including AI Engineers and Data Scientists, should prioritize integrating LLMs with symbolic solvers for optimal performance on symbolic tasks and explore alternative paradigms, such as search or interacting agents, to enhance reasoning in non-symbolic domains.   |
| Preference Tuning with Human Feedback on Language, Speech, and Vision Tasks: A Survey (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11564) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.11564))| David D. Yao, Wenpin Tang, anirbandas, BraceZHY, gentaiscool | This survey paper provides a thorough overview of recent advancements in preference tuning, a crucial process for aligning deep generative models with human preferences, across language, speech, and vision tasks. The paper presents a systematic framework and classification of preference tuning methods, categorizing them by sampling methods (online or offline), modality (text, speech, vision, etc.), language, and reward granularity (sample or token level).  The authors also describe various applications of preference tuning for improving generation quality using human feedback and discuss evaluation methods, highlighting both automatic LLM-based approaches and human-based evaluations. This survey is highly relevant to practitioners, such as AI engineers and data scientists, who aim to enhance the alignment of deep generative models with human preferences, leading to more human-like and desirable outputs in various domains, including text generation, image synthesis, and speech synthesis.   |
| GRIN: GRadient-INformed MoE (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12136) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.12136))| uuu6, liangchen-ms, Shuohang, ykim362, LiyuanLucasLiu | The paper introduces GRIN, a novel training method for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, designed to overcome the limitations of discrete expert routing in gradient-based optimization. GRIN leverages SparseMixer-v2, a method that estimates gradients for expert routing directly, instead of relying on gating gradients as a proxy. This approach, combined with a modified load balance loss and the use of tensor parallelism instead of expert parallelism, allows for efficient scaling of MoE models without token dropping. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of GRIN by developing a 16x3.8B MoE model that outperforms a 7B dense model and matches a 14B dense model, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, especially in coding and mathematics. These results highlight GRIN's potential for AI engineers and data scientists seeking to build highly scalable and performant MoE models for complex tasks.   |
| Takin: A Cohort of Superior Quality Zero-shot Speech Generation Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12139) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.12139))| yangyutu, sonaxyjh, ClorisLIN, YanniHu, ch3cook-fdu | The research introduces Takin AudioLLM, a suite of zero-shot speech generation models including Takin TTS, Takin VC, and Takin Morphing, aimed at high-quality, customizable audiobook production. Takin TTS, a neural codec language model, leverages a multi-task training strategy and a latent diffusion model for natural and robust speech synthesis. Takin VC employs joint content-timbre modeling and conditional flow matching for high-fidelity voice conversion. Takin Morphing allows timbre and prosody customization using an attention-based multi-reference timbre encoder and a language model-based prosody encoder.  Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of Takin AudioLLM models over conventional methods in terms of speech quality, speaker similarity, and style control, making it a valuable tool for AI engineers and data scientists working on speech generation and audiobook production.   |
| Towards Diverse and Efficient Audio Captioning via Diffusion Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09401) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.09401))| Ruibo Fu, Yong Ren, Xinyi Tu, Manjie Xu, Chenxinglili | This paper presents Diffusion-based Audio Captioning (DAC), a novel non-autoregressive model for audio captioning that leverages a diffusion framework.  DAC operates within the continuous text latent space and conditions the denoising process on audio features through cross-attention. Experimental results demonstrate that DAC achieves competitive captioning quality compared to state-of-the-art autoregressive models while exhibiting superior performance in terms of generation diversity and speed. Notably, the authors observe that DAC benefits significantly from pre-training on larger audio datasets and that semantic similarity metrics like CLAP and BERT might be more suitable for evaluating captioning quality compared to traditional token-level metrics.  DAC's efficiency and diversity make it a compelling solution for AI practitioners interested in deploying audio captioning models in resource-constrained environments or real-time applications.   |
| A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12181) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.12181))| Jing Nathan Yan, Yi Lu, zy001, justintchiu, sonta7 | This research presents a controlled empirical study of long-context extension methods in Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors standardize evaluation across various exact and approximate attention methods, utilizing LLaMA2-7B as a consistent base model, trained on a 1B token long-context dataset. Results indicate that perplexity remains a reliable indicator of downstream task performance for exact attention methods, while approximate attention suffers from reduced accuracy, especially in retrieval tasks. Notably, continual fine-tuning with exact attention proves effective within the extended context length, while extrapolation to unseen lengths presents challenges. These findings, coupled with the open-sourced code and models, offer AI practitioners valuable insights into selecting and implementing appropriate context extension methods for their LLM applications, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy, computational cost, and generalization capabilities.   |
| Vista3D: Unravel the 3D Darkside of a Single Image (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12193) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.12193))| Michael Bi Mi, wxcTest, adamdad, florinshum | The authors present Vista3D, a novel coarse-to-fine framework for generating diverse and consistent 3D objects from single images using 2D diffusion priors. Vista3D utilizes Gaussian Splatting to efficiently establish a coarse 3D geometry, subsequently refining it into a signed distance field representation with disentangled textures. Notably, Vista3D leverages a novel angular composition approach, constraining diffusion prior gradients to balance diversity in the unseen 3D aspects with overall consistency. Experiments demonstrate Vista3D's ability to generate high-fidelity textured meshes in 5 minutes, outperforming existing methods in speed and quality. This framework offers practitioners, including AI engineers and data scientists, a robust and efficient tool for single-view 3D object reconstruction, with potential applications in areas such as virtual reality and 3D content creation.   |

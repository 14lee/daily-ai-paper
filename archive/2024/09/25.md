| HelloBench: Evaluating Long Text Generation Capabilities of Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16191) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.16191))| Liqun He, Feiyu Duan, zsytony, zhangysk, quehry | The research paper "HelloBench: Evaluating Long Text Generation Capabilities of Large Language Models" introduces a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the long-form text generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The benchmark, called HelloBench, is structured around Bloom's Taxonomy and comprises five tasks: open-ended QA, summarization, chat, text completion, and heuristic text generation, encompassing a diverse range of 38 subcategories and 647 testing samples. To facilitate efficient evaluation, the authors propose a human-aligned evaluation method called HelloEval, which uses LLM-as-a-Judge and demonstrates superior correlation with human evaluation compared to traditional metrics. The key finding of the study is that current LLMs, despite advancements, demonstrate limitations in generating long-form text, often favoring shorter outputs or generating longer text with compromised quality. This research is relevant to practitioners such as AI engineers and data scientists, as it provides a standardized benchmark and evaluation method to guide the development and fine-tuning of LLMs for long-form text generation tasks, a critical area for real-world applications.   |
| Making Text Embedders Few-Shot Learners (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15700) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.15700))| Kun Luo, Jianlyu Chen, Shitao Xiao, MingHao Qin, cfli | This research paper proposes a novel approach called **bge-en-icl** that integrates in-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) to enhance the generation of text embeddings, enabling them to excel in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on MTEB and AIR-Bench benchmarks without modifying the LLM architecture, relying instead on enriching the query prompt with task-specific examples.  Findings suggest that retaining the original, unmodified architecture often yields the best results, highlighting the strength of ICL in adapting to new tasks without complex architectural alterations.  Practitioners, such as AI engineers and data scientists, can leverage this model to build more versatile text embedding systems that can readily adapt to diverse scenarios without extensive fine-tuning, facilitating better performance in information retrieval, text classification, and other NLP tasks.   |
| Present and Future Generalization of Synthetic Image Detectors (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14128) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.14128))| Enrique Lopez-Cuena, dariog, pabberpe | This paper investigates the generalization capacity of synthetic image detectors amidst the rapid evolution of AI image generation models. The authors find that no single detector consistently outperforms others across diverse datasets and generative models, suggesting that universal detectors are presently elusive. Experiments demonstrate that training detectors on images generated by newer models enhances their ability to detect both old and new synthetic content. This highlights a race equilibrium effect where better generators lead to better detectors and vice-versa, emphasizing the need for continuous development and evaluation of detectors in this dynamic field. For practitioners, this research underscores the importance of using diverse training datasets, incorporating the latest generation models, and remaining cognizant of the limitations of current detectors when deploying them in real-world applications.   |
| MonoFormer: One Transformer for Both Diffusion and Autoregression (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16280) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.16280))| Errui Ding, Haocheng Feng, Wenhao Wang, Yuxing Song, Chuyang Zhao | The research paper "MonoFormer: One Transformer for Both Diffusion and Autoregression" introduces a novel approach to utilizing a single transformer for both autoregressive text generation and diffusion-based image generation.  The authors leverage the similarities between transformer training for these two modalities, primarily differing in the attention mask employed, to achieve comparable performance in image generation to state-of-the-art methods, while retaining text generation capabilities. This is a significant development for practitioners as it offers a unified and potentially more efficient architecture for multi-modal tasks, simplifying development and potentially reducing computational overhead for AI engineers and data scientists working with text and image data. The demonstrated performance on ImageNet and commonsense reasoning benchmarks, along with ablation studies highlighting the importance of pretrained LLMs and bidirectional attention, underscores the potential of MonoFormer for advancing multi-modal learning.   |
| MaskBit: Embedding-free Image Generation via Bit Tokens (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16211) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.16211))| Xiaohui Shen, Xueqing Deng, Qihang Yu, Lijun Yu, Mark Weber | The authors propose MaskBit, a novel transformer-based image generation model that operates directly on bit tokens, eliminating the need for embedding tables typically found in VQGAN-based approaches. Through a systematic study, they modernize a widely-used VQGAN model, achieving state-of-the-art image reconstruction performance. They demonstrate that bit tokens, derived from binary quantization, exhibit a structured semantic representation, making them suitable for image generation. MaskBit achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet 256x256 generation benchmark, surpassing prior art while using a compact generator. This work provides AI practitioners with an efficient and high-performing method for image generation, offering advantages in terms of computational cost and memory footprint due to the embedding-free design.    |
| MIMO: Controllable Character Video Synthesis with Spatial Decomposed Modeling (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16160) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.16160))| Liefeng Bo, Miaomiao Cui, Yuan Yao, Yifang Men | The paper proposes MIMO, a novel framework for controllable character video synthesis that leverages spatial decomposition modeling for enhanced control and realism. MIMO uniquely decomposes video clips into spatially distinct components - human, scene, and occlusion - which are encoded into latent codes and fed into a diffusion-based decoder for video reconstruction. This approach allows for flexible manipulation of character appearance, motion, and scene interaction through user-provided inputs like images and pose sequences.  The key result is the ability to generate high-fidelity character videos with complex 3D motions and realistic object interactions. MIMO presents a powerful tool for AI engineers and data scientists in domains like animation, virtual reality, and video editing, enabling them to synthesize and manipulate character-driven videos with unprecedented control and realism.   |

Guerreiro, Jo√£o Alves, Patrick Fernandes, Pedro Henrique Martins | The authors introduce EuroLLM, a project focused on developing multilingual language models (LLMs) proficient in all official European Union languages and several other relevant languages. The researchers meticulously constructed a massive multilingual dataset, developed a custom tokenizer, and explored different modeling and pre-training configurations based on scaling laws.  Their initial models, EuroLLM-1.7B and EuroLLM-1.7B-Instruct, demonstrate strong performance on multilingual benchmarks and machine translation tasks. Notably, EuroLLM-1.7B-Instruct exhibits superior performance in machine translation across various language pairs compared to existing models with significantly larger parameter sizes, highlighting its efficacy for multilingual NLP applications.  This work holds significant implications for AI practitioners, particularly those working on multilingual natural language processing tasks, as it offers a robust foundation and valuable resources for developing and deploying LLMs for a wide range of European languages.   |
| Gen2Act: Human Video Generation in Novel Scenarios enables Generalizable Robot Manipulation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16283) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.16283))| Carl Doersch, Shubham Tulsiani, Abhinav Gupta, Debidatta Dwibedi, Homanga Bharadhwaj | The paper "Gen2Act: Human Video Generation in Novel Scenarios enables Generalizable Robot Manipulation" introduces a novel framework for generalizable robot manipulation that leverages zero-shot human video generation from web data and limited robot demonstrations. Gen2Act addresses the challenge of generalizing to unseen scenarios, objects, and motions by first generating a human video of the desired task using a pre-trained video generation model. A closed-loop policy then translates this video into robot actions, implicitly learning motion cues from the generated human behavior.  Evaluations show Gen2Act significantly outperforms baselines in generalization tasks, especially to unseen object types and motion types.  This framework holds significant potential for AI practitioners, particularly in robotics, by offering a scalable and efficient way to develop robot manipulation policies that generalize to new tasks and environments without the need for extensive robot data collection.   |
| Seeing Faces in Things: A Model and Dataset for Pareidolia (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16143) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.16143))| Jennifer Corbett, Anne Harrington, Vasha DuTell, Simon Stent, mhamilton723 | The paper, "Seeing Faces in Things: A Model and Dataset for Pareidolia", by Corbett, Harrington, DuTell, et al. explores the phenomenon of face pareidolia ‚Äì seeing faces in random stimuli ‚Äì from a computer vision perspective. The authors introduce "Faces in Things", a novel dataset of 5,000 annotated pareidolic face images, and demonstrate that a state-of-the-art face detector, while excelling at detecting human faces, struggles with pareidolic ones. Interestingly, fine-tuning the detector on animal faces significantly improves pareidolic face detection, suggesting a link between the perception of animal and pareidolic faces. This work provides valuable insights for AI practitioners, particularly those working on face detection, by highlighting the limitations of current models and suggesting avenues for improvement, such as incorporating training data that reflects the diversity of features present in both animal and pareidolic faces. Understanding pareidolia could lead to more robust face detectors, minimizing false positives and potentially enhancing visual attention mechanisms in AI systems.   |
| DynaMo: In-Domain Dynamics Pretraining for Visuo-Motor Control (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12192) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.12192))| Lerrel Pinto, Siddhant Haldar, Aadhithya Iyer, Hengkai Pan, Zichen Jeff Cui | DynaMo is a novel self-supervised learning method for pretraining visual representations for visuomotor control tasks. DynaMo operates by jointly learning an image encoder alongside inverse and forward dynamics models from unlabeled, sequential visual demonstrations, without relying on data augmentation or contrastive learning. Experiments demonstrate that DynaMo outperforms existing self-supervised methods and pretrained representations on both simulated and real-world robotic manipulation benchmarks. This approach is particularly relevant for AI engineers and roboticists working with limited demonstration data, as it offers a data-efficient method for learning robust visual representations for robot control.  The authors posit that the method's efficacy stems from its ability to leverage the inherent temporal structure in demonstrations, enabling it to learn task-specific features more effectively.   |
| Reward-Robust RLHF in LLMs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15360) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.15360))| Jian Xie, Yiping Zhang, Jialian Li, Xingzhou Lou, Yuzi Yan | The authors introduce a novel reward-robust RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) framework to enhance the alignment of LLMs (Large Language Models) with human preferences while addressing limitations in reward modeling. The proposed framework employs Bayesian Reward Model Ensembles (BRME) to capture the uncertainty inherent in reward signals and uses a trade-off objective function that balances performance and robustness during optimization.  Empirical evaluations across diverse benchmarks show that the framework consistently outperforms traditional RLHF, demonstrating improved stability and accuracy, especially in long-term training. This approach is particularly relevant for AI practitioners as it tackles the crucial challenge of reward hacking, where LLMs exploit imperfections in reward models, leading to suboptimal performance. By incorporating the proposed reward-robust framework, AI engineers and data scientists can develop LLMs that are more reliable, generalize better, and are less susceptible to unintended behaviors.   |

SLIMER-IT, adapting the English SLIMER model, employs instruction tuning with prompts enriched by entity definitions and annotation guidelines, enabling superior performance on unseen entity tags. Experiments demonstrate SLIMER-IT's effectiveness on a newly defined zero-shot NER benchmark for Italian,  outperforming existing methods, especially in identifying previously unseen entities. This work holds practical implications for AI practitioners working with Italian language data, offering an effective tool for tasks like information extraction, question answering, and knowledge base construction, even with limited annotated data.  Future work will focus on extending the benchmark and improving scalability for larger label sets.   |

This architecture enables Time-MoE to scale to 2.4 billion parameters while maintaining computational efficiency by activating only a subset of networks for each prediction.  Trained on Time-300B, a newly introduced dataset comprising over 300 billion time points across 9 domains, Time-MoE significantly outperforms existing forecasting models on six benchmarks in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. The results validate the scaling laws for training tokens and model size in time series forecasting, demonstrating superior performance compared to dense models with equivalent computational budgets. This work offers practitioners a powerful, efficient, and flexible solution for real-world time series forecasting, allowing them to develop and deploy larger, more capable models with reduced computational costs.   |

| OmniGen: Unified Image Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11340) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.11340))| stingw, Ruiran, avery00, JUNJIE99, Shitao | The research introduces OmniGen, a novel diffusion-based model for unified image generation. Unlike task-specific models, OmniGen handles diverse tasks such as text-to-image generation, image editing, and subject-driven generation within a single framework. Trained on the newly introduced X2I dataset, a large-scale, multi-task dataset, OmniGen exhibits emergent capabilities like task composition and in-context learning for unseen tasks.  Evaluation on benchmarks like GenEval and EMU-Edit demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models. This advancement is particularly relevant to AI practitioners, offering a unified and simplified approach to various image generation tasks within a single, efficient model.   |
| NVLM: Open Frontier-Class Multimodal LLMs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11402) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.11402))| tuomass, jon-barker, zihanliu, boxin-wbx, nayeon7lee | The paper presents NVLM 1.0, a family of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that achieve state-of-the-art results on a variety of vision-language tasks. NVLM 1.0 comes in three architectures: decoder-only (NVLM-D), cross-attention-based (NVLM-X), and a novel hybrid architecture (NVLM-H), each offering unique advantages in computational efficiency and reasoning capabilities.  Importantly, NVLM 1.0 models demonstrate "production-grade multimodality," excelling in both vision-language and text-only tasks, without sacrificing performance in either domain.  This is achieved through a combination of novel model design, the introduction of a 1-D tile tagging design for high-resolution images, and careful curation of training data that emphasizes quality and task diversity over scale. Practitioners can benefit from these insights for building more robust and versatile MLLMs applicable to a wide range of tasks, from visual question answering to code generation.   |
| Phidias: A Generative Model for Creating 3D Content from Text, Image, and 3D Conditions with Reference-Augmented Diffusion (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11406) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.11406))| Gerhard Hancke, liuziwei7, zxhezexin, tfwang, ZhenweiWang | Phidias is a novel generative model that employs diffusion for reference-augmented 3D content creation. The model leverages a user-provided or retrieved 3D reference to enhance the 3D generation process, thereby improving the generation quality, generalizability, and controllability. Phidias unifies 3D generation from textual, image-based, and 3D prompts, providing a variety of downstream applications for practitioners, such as retrieval-augmented image-to-3D or text-to-3D generation. The authors demonstrate through extensive experiments that Phidias outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively. The source code for Phidias is publicly available.   |
| Fine-Tuning Image-Conditional Diffusion Models is Easier than You Think (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11355) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.11355))| Alexander Hermans, Christian Schmidt, ddegeus, kabouzeid, GonzaloMG | This research paper demonstrates that the perceived inefficiency of image-conditional latent diffusion models for monocular depth estimation, such as Marigold, is due to a flawed inference pipeline. By fixing the DDIM scheduler implementation, the authors achieve single-step inference performance comparable to multi-step, ensembled approaches, with a speed increase of over 200x.  Furthermore, simple end-to-end fine-tuning of these models with task-specific losses, even starting from a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, surpasses the performance of more complex, specifically designed architectures. These findings are particularly relevant to practitioners, as they enable the use of high-precision, diffusion-based depth and normal estimation models in real-time applications, while also simplifying the training and optimization process.   |

AgentTorch addresses the challenge of simulating large populations with adaptive behaviors by introducing the concept of LLM archetypes, enabling the simulation of millions of agents informed by LLM outputs. The authors demonstrate AgentTorch's capabilities through a case study of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, showcasing its ability to capture realistic population-wide behaviors and simulate the impact of policy interventions. AgentTorch provides practitioners, including AI engineers and data scientists, with a powerful tool for understanding and addressing complex societal challenges through the integration of LLM-driven agent behavior in ABMs.   |
| OSV: One Step is Enough for High-Quality Image to Video Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11367) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.11367))| Jiangning Zhang, Wenbing Zhu, Zhengkai Jiang, Xiaofeng Mao, wangfuyun | The authors present OSV (One Step Video Generation), a novel two-stage training approach for image-to-video generation using diffusion models that achieves high-quality results in just one inference step. OSV leverages latent GAN training in the first stage for rapid quality improvement and incorporates adversarial consistency distillation in the second stage to enhance performance and stability.  The authors introduce a unique video discriminator design using pretrained image backbones (DINOv2) and a lightweight trainable head, significantly reducing computational costs by replacing the VAE decoding process with upsampling.  Evaluations on the OpenWebVid-1M benchmark demonstrate OSV's superior performance over existing methods in both speed and visual quality. OSV presents a significant advancement for practitioners, such as AI engineers and data scientists, working with video generation, offering a fast and efficient solution for high-quality results.   |
| A Comprehensive Evaluation of Quantized Instruction-Tuned Large Language Models: An Experimental Analysis up to 405B (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11055) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.11055))| Yongin Kwon, Sihyeong Park, oj9040, kwonse, leejaymin | This research paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the quantization of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), spanning models from 7B to 405B parameters and four quantization methods (GPTQ, AWQ, SmoothQuant, and FP8). The authors found that quantized larger LLMs often outperform smaller, full-precision models on various tasks, except for hallucination detection and instruction following. Importantly, the study highlights that weight-only quantization methods, particularly AWQ, generally yield better accuracy preservation in large models compared to quantization methods involving activations. The findings are particularly relevant for practitioners, such as AI engineers and data scientists, aiming to deploy large LLMs under resource constraints while maintaining performance. The authors emphasize that selecting the optimal quantization method and bit precision should be done based on the specific LLM size and target task.   |

This work provides AI practitioners a robust and accessible framework for developing high-quality T2A applications.   |
| SplatFields: Neural Gaussian Splats for Sparse 3D and 4D Reconstruction (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11211) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.11211))| Robert Maier, Siyu Tang, Aeriphi, sprokudin, markomih | This paper presents SplatFields, a novel optimization strategy for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that addresses the technique's limitations in sparse view scenarios. SplatFields introduces a spatial bias during optimization by leveraging neural networks to predict splat features, encouraging nearby primitives to share similar characteristics and emulating the behavior of implicit volumetric rendering methods. This approach significantly improves reconstruction quality under sparse view conditions for both static and dynamic scenes, outperforming recent 3DGS and NeRF-based alternatives. Notably, SplatFields maintains real-time rendering capabilities and compatibility with existing 3DGS pipelines, making it particularly attractive for practitioners seeking efficient and high-quality 3D reconstruction from limited input data. AI engineers and data scientists working on 3D vision applications such as scene reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and dynamic scene modeling can benefit from incorporating SplatFields to enhance performance and efficiency in their workflows.   |
| Agile Continuous Jumping in Discontinuous Terrains (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10923) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.10923))| Changyi Lin, mateoguaman, romesco, guanya, yxyang | This paper proposes a novel hierarchical learning and control framework for enabling quadrupedal robots to perform agile, continuous jumping in discontinuous terrains, such as stairs and stepping stones. The framework consists of a learned heightmap predictor for terrain perception, an RL-trained motion policy for planning, and a model-based leg controller for motion tracking. A key contribution is the reduction of the sim-to-real gap by accurately modeling hardware characteristics, such as motor saturation and camera latency. This allows the robot to achieve state-of-the-art performance, traversing a 14-step staircase in 4.5 seconds, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach for agile locomotion in challenging terrains. This work holds significant implications for practitioners, including AI Engineers and roboticists, seeking to develop robots capable of navigating complex real-world environments with enhanced agility and speed.   |

The authors release MusicRender, an extension to the MusPy library, to facilitate accurate parsing and rendering of nuanced musical notation from MusicXML. Experiments on multitrack symbolic music generation demonstrate that filtering PDMX based on user ratings improves model performance in terms of harmonic and rhythmic diversity. Notably, fine-tuning models on a small subset of high-quality, rated data significantly enhances generation quality. PDMX offers AI practitioners a valuable resource for developing and evaluating symbolic music processing models, particularly in the domains of music generation, transcription, and recommendation.   |
| Measuring and Enhancing Trustworthiness of LLMs in RAG through Grounded Attributions and Learning to Refuse (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11242) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.11242))| Navonil Majumder, Hai Leong Chieu, Rishabh Bhardwaj, Shang Hong Sim, Maojia Song | This paper addresses the issue of hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) within the context of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The authors propose a novel metric, TRUST-SCORE, to evaluate the trustworthiness of LLMs in a RAG setting by assessing grounded refusals, answer accuracy, and citation correctness. To improve trustworthiness, they introduce TRUST-ALIGN, an alignment framework that trains LLMs on a synthetic dataset to identify answerable questions, ground responses in provided documents, and avoid unnecessary refusals. Experiments demonstrate that TRUST-ALIGN enhances LLM performance across three datasets, achieving comparable results to leading closed-source language models like GPT-4. These findings are particularly relevant to AI engineers and data scientists developing RAG systems, emphasizing the importance of aligning LLMs with external knowledge sources to mitigate hallucination and improve the reliability of generated information.   |

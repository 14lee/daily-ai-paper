| Attention Heads of Large Language Models: A Survey | Yezhaohui Wang, jimi888, Ki-Seki, saythe17, fan2goa1 | This paper surveys recent research on attention heads in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their role in reasoning processes. The authors propose a novel four-stage framework, inspired by human cognition, to categorize attention head functions: Knowledge Recalling, In-Context Identification, Latent Reasoning, and Expression Preparation.  Furthermore, the paper summarizes experimental methodologies for investigating attention head mechanisms, categorized as Modeling-Free and Modeling-Required approaches.

These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in advancing fuzzing techniques, offering a valuable tool for AI engineers and data scientists involved in software security testing and vulnerability analysis.   | [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01944) |
| CDM: A Reliable Metric for Fair and Accurate Formula Recognition Evaluation | conghui, BoZhang, renqiux0302, ouyanglinke, wanderkid | This research paper proposes a novel evaluation metric called Character Detection Matching (CDM) for formula recognition tasks. Addressing the limitations of existing text-based metrics like BLEU, CDM evaluates formula recognition by comparing rendered images of predicted and ground-truth formulas, utilizing visual character matching. Experiments demonstrate that CDM offers a more accurate and fairer assessment of formula recognition models, particularly in scenarios with diverse formula representations. Notably, the study shows that by using CDM for training data selection, comparable model performance can be achieved using only a fraction (less than 20%) of the data. This finding offers valuable insights for practitioners, such as AI engineers and data scientists, enabling more efficient model training and dataset construction in the field of formula recognition.   | [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03643) |
| mPLUG-DocOwl2: High-resolution Compressing for OCR-free Multi-page Document Understanding | Liang Zhang, Jingren, hzhwcmhf, xhyandwyy, AnwenHu | mPLUG-DocOwl2 is a novel Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) designed for efficient OCR-free multi-page document understanding. The authors introduce a High-resolution DocCompressor module that leverages cross-attention with global visual features to effectively compress high-resolution document images into a fixed number of tokens (324). This approach reduces computational overhead and inference time while maintaining comparable performance to state-of-the-art MLLMs on various document understanding benchmarks. DocOwl2's ability to process high-resolution images and efficiently extract textual information is beneficial for practitioners, such as AI engineers and data scientists, developing applications for multi-page document analysis, question answering, and information retrieval. The reduction in computational resources required for processing high-resolution images makes DocOwl2 particularly relevant for real-world applications.   | [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03420) |
| Geometry Image Diffusion: Fast and Data-Efficient Text-to-3D with Image-Based Surface Representation | simondonn, CiaraRowles, SlavaElizarov | This research introduces Geometry Image Diffusion (GIMDiffusion), a novel Text-to-3D framework that leverages geometry images as the 3D representation. By employing a Collaborative Control scheme with a pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion model, GIMDiffusion generates 3D objects with high fidelity and diversity from text prompts, eliminating the need for complex 3D-aware architectures. Results demonstrate its capability to produce relightable 3D assets efficiently, comparable to existing Text-to-Image methods. GIMDiffusion offers a practical and efficient approach for AI practitioners, particularly AI Engineers and Data Scientists, working in 3D content creation, as it simplifies both model design and training while leveraging existing resources. Furthermore, the generated objects consist of semantically meaningful, separable parts, enhancing their usability and versatility for tasks such as editing and animation.   | [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03718) |
| WildVis: Open Source Visualizer for Million-Scale Chat Logs in the Wild | Xiang Ren, Wenting Zhao, yejinchoinka, jmhessel, yuntian-deng | WILDVIS is an open-source interactive tool designed for the exploration and analysis of large-scale conversational datasets, particularly interactions between users and chatbots.

| Guide-and-Rescale: Self-Guidance Mechanism for Effective Tuning-Free Real Image Editing | Dmitry Vetrov, Madina Khalmatova, ai-alanov, sashapff, macderru | The paper, "Guide-and-Rescale: Self-Guidance Mechanism for Effective Tuning-Free Real Image Editing", introduces a novel image editing method called Guide-and-Rescale.  This method leverages a self-guidance technique within a diffusion model framework to balance high-quality editing with the preservation of the original image structure. The authors achieve this by introducing energy functions, referred to as "guiders," designed to maintain both global layout and local visual characteristics during the editing process.  The paper presents a noise rescaling mechanism, ensuring consistent behavior across a diverse range of images, and demonstrates its effectiveness through both qualitative and quantitative analysis on various editing tasks, such as changing object appearance, style transfer, and image manipulation. Practitioners, including AI engineers and data scientists, can utilize this method for real-time, high-fidelity image editing applications without the need for extensive model fine-tuning or computationally expensive inversion processes.  | [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01322) |

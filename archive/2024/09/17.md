| RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Vector Retrieval (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10516) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.10516))| zqx123, hzhua, iofu728, baotonglu, Matchyc | This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach leveraging approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) to accelerate the inference of long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) by exploiting the dynamic sparsity inherent in the attention mechanism. The key innovation lies in addressing the out-of-distribution (OOD) challenge between query and key vectors in attention computation through an attention-aware vector search algorithm. This enables RetrievalAttention to accurately approximate attention with significantly reduced latency and minimal GPU memory footprint, achieving a 4.9x and 1.98x speedup compared to exact KNN and traditional ANNS methods respectively. RetrievalAttention presents a practical solution for AI practitioners working with LLMs on long sequences, particularly beneficial for deployment on resource-constrained devices.   |
| Guiding Vision-Language Model Selection for Visual Question-Answering Across Tasks, Domains, and Knowledge Types (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09269) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.09269))| Vinija Jain, amanchadha, neelabhsinha | This research paper proposes a comprehensive framework for evaluating and selecting optimal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for specific Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, addressing practical application needs.  The authors introduce a novel multi-dimensional dataset that classifies VQA tasks by task type, application domain, and knowledge type, facilitating fine-grained VLM performance comparisons. Additionally, a new evaluation metric, GoEval, is presented, demonstrating superior alignment with human judgments compared to traditional metrics by leveraging GPT-40's capabilities for multimodal evaluation. Experimental results reveal significant performance variations among 10 state-of-the-art VLMs across categories, with proprietary models generally outperforming open-source alternatives.  These findings provide AI practitioners (AI Engineers, Data Scientists) with actionable insights and a standardized framework for selecting best-suited VLMs based on specific task requirements, resource constraints, and performance expectations.   |
| ReCLAP: Improving Zero Shot Audio Classification by Describing Sounds (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09213) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.09213))| Sonal Kumar, Sreyan Ghosh, manocha, RamaniD, urinieto | The research proposes ReCLAP, an improved CLAP model for zero-shot audio classification (ZSAC) that enhances sound understanding by incorporating descriptive features into prompts. ReCLAP leverages caption augmentation during training, prompting a Large Language Model (LLM) to rewrite captions with detailed acoustic descriptions.  Further improving ZSAC, the authors introduce prompt augmentation, generating multiple custom prompts per category using LLM-based descriptions in diverse scenes.  ReCLAP exhibits state-of-the-art performance on various retrieval and ZSAC benchmarks, demonstrating the importance of descriptive sound features in prompts. This development holds significant relevance for AI practitioners, particularly those working on audio classification and retrieval systems, by providing a method to improve zero-shot performance and generalization capabilities.   |
| On the Diagram of Thought (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10038) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.10038))| Andrew Chi-Chih Yao, Yang Yuan, yifAI | The paper introduces Diagram of Thought (DoT), a novel framework for enhancing iterative reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by representing the process as the construction of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) within a single model. Unlike linear or tree-based reasoning approaches, DoT incorporates propositions, critiques, refinements, and verifications as nodes within the DAG, capturing the non-linear and iterative nature of human reasoning. By employing auto-regressive next-token prediction with role-specific tokens, DoT facilitates seamless transitions between reasoning steps within the LLM, eliminating the need for multiple models or external control mechanisms. Furthermore, the authors provide a robust mathematical foundation for DoT using Topos Theory and PreNet Categories, ensuring the logical consistency and soundness of the reasoning process. This framework offers AI practitioners a theoretically grounded and practically efficient approach to develop LLMs with enhanced reasoning capabilities for complex problem-solving tasks.   |
| AudioBERT: Audio Knowledge Augmented Language Model (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08199) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.08199))| Jaeho Lee, uso7d0, HJOK | This paper introduces AuditoryBench, the first benchmark designed to assess the auditory knowledge of large language models (LLMs). The authors find that LLMs pretrained solely on text data exhibit a significant lack of auditory commonsense knowledge. To address this, they propose AudioBERT, a novel framework that augments LLMs with auditory knowledge through a retrieval-based approach using a combination of auditory knowledge span detection and the CLAP audio-text model. Experiments demonstrate that AudioBERT significantly enhances the ability of LLMs to understand and reason about auditory information. This research has practical implications for AI practitioners, particularly those working on audio-language multimodal tasks such as audio captioning, sound recognition, and audio question answering. The availability of AudioBERT and AuditoryBench provides valuable resources for developing more robust and versatile multimodal AI systems.   |

The authors introduce the novel Layer of Comics Understanding (LoCU) framework, a taxonomy that categorizes tasks based on input/output modalities and spatio-temporal dimensions, ranging from basic tagging and augmentation to complex generation and synthesis. The survey systematically reviews existing datasets and methodologies, highlighting the limitations in data availability, annotation standardization, and task complexity, and proposes potential research directions. Practitioners, such as AI engineers and data scientists, can leverage this survey to understand the current state of the field, identify potential applications of VLMs in comics analysis and generation, and contribute to the development of more robust and versatile models for this complex domain.   |
| Ferret: Federated Full-Parameter Tuning at Scale for Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06277) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.06277))| Fei Richard Yu, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low, See-Kiong Ng, Wenyang Hu, ZCODE0 | Ferret is a novel first-order federated learning algorithm designed for scalable full-parameter tuning of large language models (LLMs) with enhanced privacy. It leverages shared randomness to reduce communication costs by projecting local updates into a low-dimensional space and reconstructing them efficiently during global aggregation.  Theoretical analyses demonstrate that Ferret's reconstruction is unbiased and enjoys fast convergence while avoiding error accumulation often observed in zeroth-order methods.  Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets confirm Ferret's superior scalability and competitive model accuracy compared to existing federated full-parameter and parameter-efficient tuning methods. This work holds significant implications for practitioners, especially AI engineers and data scientists, enabling them to efficiently fine-tune LLMs on decentralized datasets with improved privacy while maintaining performance.   |
| beeFormer: Bridging the Gap Between Semantic and Interaction Similarity in Recommender Systems (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10309) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.10309))| Pavel Kord√≠k, foxik, beeformer | The authors propose *beeFormer*, a novel framework that bridges the gap between semantic and interaction similarity for recommender systems. This is accomplished by training sentence transformer models directly on user-item interaction data, leveraging gradient checkpointing and negative sampling for scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that beeFormer outperforms baselines in cold-start, zero-shot, and time-split recommendation tasks, indicating superior performance in scenarios with limited interaction data. Notably, training on datasets from multiple domains leads to improved knowledge transfer and domain-agnostic recommendation capabilities. These findings are especially relevant for AI practitioners, as beeFormer offers a scalable and effective approach to improve recommendation quality in challenging scenarios with limited user feedback.   |

The framework utilizes a combination of VAE and CLIP encoders to capture both fine-grained visual details and high-level clinical features from the input data, and effectively predicts potential temporal changes while generating realistic CXR images. Experimental results demonstrate EHRXDiff's superior performance in preserving medical information and generating high-quality images compared to baseline methods. This framework has the potential to serve as a valuable tool for AI practitioners, particularly in developing clinical decision support systems that assist medical professionals in monitoring disease progression and planning personalized treatment strategies.   |

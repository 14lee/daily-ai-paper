  3DGS (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02751) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.02751))| Yuan Xiong, Guanying Chen, Kunbin Yao, Yuqi Zhang, fcy99 | RobustSplat addresses artifact generation in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) due to transient objects in dynamic scenes. The paper aims to improve 3DGS optimization in in-the-wild scenarios by mitigating the influence of transient objects.

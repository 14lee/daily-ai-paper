  Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24864) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.24864))| Xin Dong, Jian Hu, Ximing Lu, Shizhe Diao, Mingjie Liu | ProRL introduces a prolonged reinforcement learning methodology to enhance reasoning in large language models. The research explores whether RL can truly expand a modelâ€™s reasoning capabilities beyond merely amplifying existing outputs and investigates the impact of extended RL training. The methodology incorporates KL divergence control, reference policy resetting, and diverse task training, scaling up to 2k training steps. Empirical results demonstrate that RL-trained models outperform base models in pass@k evaluations, with average improvements of 14.7% on math benchmarks compared to DeepSeek-R1-1.5B, and reveals RL can uncover new solution pathways entirely absent in base models. The findings suggest that prolonged RL training can enable exploration of new reasoning patterns, holding implications for AI practitioners as it demonstrates the potential for RL to meaningfully expand reasoning boundaries in language models given sufficient training time.  |

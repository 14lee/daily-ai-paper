| SRMT: Shared Memory for Multi-agent Lifelong Pathfinding (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13200) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.13200))| Yuri Kuratov, mbur, alsu-sagirova | The research introduces a Shared Recurrent Memory Transformer (SRMT) to enhance coordination in multi-agent systems by enabling implicit information exchange. The main research question is whether a shared recurrent memory mechanism can improve coordination and performance in multi-agent pathfinding tasks. The key methodology involves extending memory transformers to a multi-agent setting by pooling and broadcasting individual working memories, allowing agents to implicitly coordinate actions. Primary results show that SRMT consistently outperforms baselines in a bottleneck navigation task with sparse rewards, achieving a Cooperative Success Rate (CSR) of 1.0 on corridor lengths up to 400 cells. For AI practitioners, SRMT provides a decentralized method to improve coordination in multi-agent systems without relying on explicit communication protocols or centralized control, particularly useful in tasks requiring efficient pathfinding and cooperation.  |

The main research question is whether integrating stepwise process feedback with outcome-level feedback can improve the accuracy and coherence of LLM reasoning in mathematical problem-solving. The key methodology is Stepwise Kahneman-Tversky-inspired Optimization (STEP-KTO), which combines process-level and outcome-level binary feedback using a Kahneman-Tversky-inspired value function to guide model training iteratively. The primary results show that on the MATH-500 dataset, STEP-KTO improves the Pass@1 accuracy of the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model from 53.4% to 63.2%. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that incorporating stepwise feedback into the training process can enhance both the final answer accuracy and the intermediate reasoning quality of LLMs, leading to more reliable and interpretable mathematical reasoning systems.  |
| Debate Helps Weak-to-Strong Generalization (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13124) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.13124))| Yongbin-Li, hzhwcmhf, langnick | This paper explores using debate between AI models to improve weak-to-strong generalization in AI alignment. The main research question is whether a strong AI model can be used to improve a weak model's supervision capabilities, and then use this enhanced supervision to train the strong model. The key methodology involves finetuning a small "weak" model with help from a large "strong" model via debate, and then finetuning the strong model on labels generated by the weak model ensemble. The primary results show that debate ensembles lead to significant improvements in weak-to-strong generalization, with the approach achieving a 76.5% performance gap recovered (PGR) on the SciQ dataset, compared to 41.2% for a baseline. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that using debate to enhance weak model supervision can be a viable strategy for aligning more powerful AI models, especially when direct human supervision becomes infeasible.  |
| Evolution and The Knightian Blindspot of Machine Learning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13075) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.13075))| Tarin Ziyaee, Kenneth O. Stanley, Tarek El-Gaaly, ekmeyerson, jal278 | Machine learning (ML) overlooks the critical aspect of robustness to qualitative unknowns in open-world environments, termed Knightian uncertainty (KU). The main research question is how ML, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), is limited by its formalisms in addressing Knightian uncertainty, and how biological evolution manages this challenge. The key methodology involves a comparative analysis between RL formalisms, specifically Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), and the principles of biological evolution, highlighting mechanisms like open-ended search, diversification, and persistence. The primary results indicate that RL's standard objective, maximizing expected return with a discount factor approaching 0 with increasing time steps, leads to indifference to catastrophic events beyond a fixed time horizon. The principal implication for AI practitioners is the need to integrate mechanisms inspired by biological evolution, such as open-endedness and diversification, into ML algorithms to enhance robustness to unforeseen situations, as current formalisms limit this capability.  |
| Video-MMMU: Evaluating Knowledge Acquisition from Multi-Discipline Professional Videos (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13826) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.13826))| ZhangYuanhan, wangxiao1208, pufanyi, craigwu, KairuiHu | Video-MMMU is a benchmark for assessing knowledge acquisition in large multimodal models (LMMs) from educational videos. The main research question is how effectively LMMs can acquire and utilize knowledge from multi-discipline professional videos across three cognitive stages: perception, comprehension, and adaptation. The key methodology involves curating a dataset of 300 expert-level videos and 900 human-annotated questions across six disciplines, evaluating LMMs through stage-aligned question-answer pairs, and proposing a knowledge gain metric (∆knowledge) to quantify performance improvement after video viewing. The primary result is that the best-performing model, GPT-4o, achieved a knowledge gain (∆knowledge) of 15.6% after watching the videos, compared to a human expert's 33.1%, and model performance declines as cognitive demands increase. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that current LMMs struggle to effectively learn and apply knowledge from videos in a manner comparable to humans, highlighting a critical area for further development to enhance video-based learning capabilities.  |
| GSTAR: Gaussian Surface Tracking and Reconstruction (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10283) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.10283))| Jie Song, Juan Zarate, Chengwei Zheng, lxxue | GSTAR is a novel method for tracking and reconstructing dynamic 3D surfaces with changing topologies using Gaussian Splatting. The main research question is how to achieve photo-realistic rendering, accurate surface reconstruction, and reliable 3D tracking for dynamic scenes where the topology of surfaces changes over time. The key methodology involves binding 3D Gaussians to mesh faces to create "Gaussian Surfaces," using scene flow warping for frame-to-frame initialization, optimizing Gaussian parameters with fixed topology, then unbinding Gaussians and re-meshing to adapt to topological changes. The primary results show that GSTAR achieves a PSNR of 31.87, SSIM of 0.952, and LPIPS of 0.102 in appearance reconstruction, outperforming comparison methods. For AI practitioners, GSTAR provides a method to generate high-quality appearance and geometry reconstruction with consistent tracking for dynamic scenes, enabling advancements in areas like VR/XR, robotic interactions, and other applications requiring precise 3D representations.  |

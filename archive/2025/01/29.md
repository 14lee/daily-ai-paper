| SFT Memorizes, RL Generalizes: A Comparative Study of Foundation Model Post-training (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17161) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.17161))| Saining Xie, Shengbang Tong, Jihan Yang, Yuexiang Zhai, Tianzhe Chu | Summary of the research paper is the following: The paper investigates the effects of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on foundation model generalization and memorization in textual and visual domains. The main research question is whether SFT or RL leads to better generalization in foundation models when applied to unseen variants of learned tasks. The key methodology involves training language and vision-language models with SFT and RL on two tasks, GeneralPoints and V-IRL, and evaluating their performance on in-distribution and out-of-distribution variations of these tasks. The primary results show that RL, especially with an outcome-based reward, leads to better generalization than SFT across both tasks; for example, RL improves out-of-distribution performance on the V-IRL-L task by +11.0% (80.8% to 91.8%). The principal implication for AI practitioners is that RL should be favored over SFT when the goal is to enhance the generalization capability of foundation models to new, unseen task variants, particularly in complex, multi-modal tasks.  |
| Optimizing Large Language Model Training Using FP4 Quantization (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17116) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.17116))| Guoshuai Zhao, Xiao Liu, Yeyun Gong, Ruizhe Wang, cp5555 | This paper introduces an FP4 quantization framework for training large language models (LLMs). The main research question is whether it is feasible to train LLMs using 4-bit floating-point (FP4) quantization while maintaining accuracy comparable to higher-precision formats. The key methodology involves a differentiable quantization estimator for weight updates, an outlier clamping and compensation strategy for activations, mixed-precision training, and vector-wise quantization. The primary results demonstrate that the FP4 framework achieves accuracy comparable to BF16 and FP8, with training losses of 2.55 (FP4) vs. 2.49 (BF16) for a 1.3B parameter LLaMA model trained on 100B tokens. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that the proposed FP4 quantization method enables more efficient training of LLMs, potentially reducing computational costs and accelerating development, although the current lack of hardware support for FP4 limits direct measurement of speedup and energy efficiency gains.  |
| Over-Tokenized Transformer: Vocabulary is Generally Worth Scaling (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16975) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.16975))| Ya Wang, Yutao Zeng, Banggu Wu, Defa Zhu, Hongzhi Huang | Here is a concise summary of the research paper:  The paper introduces Over-Tokenized Transformers, a framework that decouples input and output vocabularies to improve language modeling by scaling up input vocabularies with multi-gram tokens. The main research question is how scaling input and output vocabularies separately impacts the performance of large language models. The key methodology involves using hierarchical n-gram input vocabularies and analyzing the relationship between vocabulary size and training loss through experiments on context-free grammar and natural language modeling. A primary result is a log-linear relationship between input vocabulary size and training loss, with a 400M parameter model with an input vocabulary size of 12.8 million matching the training loss of a 1B parameter baseline model. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that scaling input vocabulary size, independent of output vocabulary size, can significantly enhance model scalability and performance without increasing training costs.  |
| Open Problems in Mechanistic Interpretability (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16496) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.16496))| Jeff Wu, Jack Lindsey, Joshua Batson, Lee Sharkey, bilalchughtai | Here is a summary of the paper "Open Problems in Mechanistic Interpretability":  This paper reviews the current state and future directions of mechanistic interpretability research for neural networks. The main research objective is to identify open problems in mechanistic interpretability methods, applications, and socio-technical aspects that need to be addressed to achieve the field's scientific and engineering goals. The key methodology used is a synthesis of perspectives from various authors, combining literature review with forward-looking analysis to identify gaps and challenges. The primary results indicate that current decomposition methods, such as sparse dictionary learning, have high reconstruction errors, with one experiment showing that using sparse dictionary reconstructions in GPT-2 reduced performance by 40% when trained on the full distribution. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that significant advancements in decomposition, description, and validation methods are needed to enable reliable monitoring, control, and prediction of AI systems, particularly for safety-critical applications.  |
| DiffSplat: Repurposing Image Diffusion Models for Scalable Gaussian Splat Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16764) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.16764))| Yadong Mu, Zeming Li, Bangbang Yang, Panwang Pan, Chenguo Lin | Here is a concise summary of the research paper "DiffSplat: Repurposing Image Diffusion Models for Scalable Gaussian Splat Generation":  DiffSplat is a novel 3D generative framework that leverages pretrained image diffusion models to generate 3D Gaussian Splats. The main research objective is to develop a 3D generative model that can effectively utilize web-scale 2D image priors while maintaining 3D consistency. The key methodology involves fine-tuning image diffusion models to directly generate structured Gaussian splat grids, utilizing a lightweight reconstruction model for scalable 3D dataset curation and a 3D rendering loss for multi-view consistency. The primary result is that DiffSplat achieves a CLIP similarity score of 30.95% on single object text-conditioned generation, outperforming other methods. For AI practitioners, DiffSplat provides an efficient way to generate high-quality 3D content by repurposing existing 2D image diffusion models, establishing a bridge between 3D content creation and the image generation community.  |

The main research objective is to establish a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the performance of multilingual LLMs in understanding and generating text in Indic languages. The key methodology involved translating the English MMLU-Pro dataset into nine Indic languages using IndicTrans2 and validating the translations through back-translation, multiple evaluation metrics, and expert review. The primary results show that GPT-40 consistently outperformed other models, achieving the highest accuracy of 44.80% in Hindi. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that this benchmark can guide the development of more accurate and culturally sensitive multilingual LLMs for Indic languages, although there is a pressing need for higher-quality, diverse datasets across all Indic languages.  |
| Low-Rank Adapters Meet Neural Architecture Search for LLM Compression (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16372) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.16372))| Nilesh Jain, Jinjie Yuan, J. Pablo Mu√±oz | This paper explores synergistic methods combining low-rank adapters with neural architecture search (NAS) to compress large language models (LLMs).  The research objective is to develop robust solutions for compressing and efficiently fine-tuning large pre-trained LLMs.  The key methodology integrates low-rank representations, particularly elastic LoRA adapters, with weight-sharing super-networks from NAS techniques.  One primary result demonstrates an inference speedup of up to 1.4x while reducing model parameters by approximately 80% in some experiments. The principal implication is that these combined strategies offer efficient LLM compression and fine-tuning, making LLMs more accessible for deployment in resource-constrained environments.  |
| Histoires Morales: A French Dataset for Assessing Moral Alignment (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17117) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.17117))| Charlotte Laclau, Julien Velcin, Antoine Gourru, Irina Proskurina, Thibaud Leteno | HISTOIRESMORALES, a French dataset derived from MORALSTORIES, is introduced for evaluating moral alignment in large language models (LLMs). The main research objective is to assess how well LLMs handle moral reasoning in French and compare it to English. The key methodology involves translating the MORALSTORIES dataset into French using a refined prompting strategy with GPT-3.5-turbo-16k, followed by manual annotation and validation, and evaluating LLMs using perplexity and action selection with declarative prompts. The primary results show that LLMs align better with moral norms in English than in French, with Mistral selecting the moral action 93.78% of the time in English versus 83.59% in French when prompted with the norm. For AI practitioners, the principal implication is that the HISTOIRESMORALES dataset can be used to evaluate and improve the moral alignment of LLMs in French, highlighting the importance of language-specific datasets for nuanced evaluations of model behavior.  |

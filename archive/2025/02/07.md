| Analyze Feature Flow to Enhance Interpretation and Steering in Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03032) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.03032))| Yaroslav Aksenov, kefirski, elephantmipt, dlaptev | This paper introduces a data-free method to track the evolution of features learned by sparse autoencoders across layers of large language models, enabling improved interpretability and steering of model behavior. The main research question is how to systematically map and understand the progression of features discovered by sparse autoencoders across consecutive layers of large language models. The key methodology involves using cosine similarity between decoder weights of SAEs trained on different modules (MLP, attention, residual) and layers to trace feature persistence, transformation, or emergence. The primary results show that deactivating a single predecessor feature causes a greater activation strength drop if that predecessor is in a group with single predecessor: for example, in layer 8, this probability is approximately 0.75, 0.55 and 0.6 for "From RES", "From MLP" and "From ATT", respectively . The principal implication for AI practitioners is that this method provides a means for more precise control over model behavior by identifying and manipulating multi-layer feature circuits, offering improvements over single-layer steering approaches.  |

The main research objective is to develop a method for seamlessly integrating synthesized dynamic objects or complex scene effects into existing real-world videos, accounting for camera motion, occlusions, and interactions. The key methodology is a zero-shot, training-free framework leveraging a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion transformer and a Vision Language Model (VLM) for content synthesis and scene understanding, using a novel inference-based method with "Anchor Extended Attention" to manipulate attention features for localization and integration. The primary results show that the proposed method outperforms baselines like SDEdit and LORA fine-tuning, achieving a masked Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.860 and a CLIP Directional score of 0.311, indicating better original content preservation and edit fidelity. For AI practitioners, this method provides a framework that facilitates generating and harmonizing dynamic video effects without the need for creating and tracking masks, enabling improved video editing and synthesis capabilities using pre-trained diffusion models.  |

The main research objective is to develop an omni-modal language model that achieves competitive performance across image, video, and audio understanding compared to specialized single-modality models, while maintaining efficiency. The key methodology is a progressive modality alignment strategy that trains the model sequentially on image-text, then video, and finally audio data, along with a dual-encoder approach for audio input and sentence-wise streaming decoding for speech generation. The model achieves a mean accuracy of 72.6% on the OpenCompass benchmark and 68.4% on the VideoMME benchmark, outperforming existing open-source omni-modal LLMs and many specialized models.

| Great Models Think Alike and this Undermines AI Oversight (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04313) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.04313))| AmeyaPrabhu, douwekiela, iaa01, Klingspor, shash42 | This paper studies how model similarity affects AI oversight, finding that greater similarity biases evaluations and reduces gains from training on Language Model (LM) annotations, with model errors becoming more correlated as capabilities increase. The main research question is how model similarity impacts the effectiveness of AI oversight, both in evaluation (LLM-as-a-judge) and training (using LM annotations). The key methodology involves proposing Chance Adjusted Probabilistic Agreement (CAPA), a new metric for LM similarity based on the overlap in model mistakes, and using it to analyze LLM-as-a-judge and training on LM annotation scenarios. Primary results show LLM-as-a-judge scores are significantly correlated with model similarity (average Pearson r=0.84), and gains from weak-to-strong generalization are higher when the supervisor and student models are more dissimilar. For AI practitioners, increasing model similarity poses a risk due to correlated failures, indicating a need for measuring and reporting model similarity and developing methods for training diverse models.  |

The main research question is how effective MAGA-generated synthetic data is for expanding pretraining corpus and aiding model scaling under data-constrained scenarios. The key methodology involves a two-stage synthesis process using a 3.3B MoE model to generate multiple genre-audience reformulations of documents, followed by heuristic cleaning. Primary results show that models trained with MAGA-expanded data (MAGA-Mix) achieved consistent improvements across model sizes (134M-1.7B parameters), with a +2.15 average performance gain on the 1.7B model, and substantial gains in TriviaQA (+15.47) and GSM8K (+6.06). For AI practitioners, MAGA offers a scalable method to expand training datasets and improve model performance, particularly when high-quality natural language data is scarce, providing an avenue for model scaling.  |
| Llasa: Scaling Train-Time and Inference-Time Compute for Llama-based Speech Synthesis (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04128) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.04128))| Xinsheng Wang, Chi-Min Chan, Xinfa Zhu, HKUST-Audio, ZhenYe234 | Llasa explores scaling train-time and inference-time compute for Llama-based text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, demonstrating improvements in naturalness, prosody, and expressiveness. The main research objective is to investigate the effects of scaling both training and inference computation on the performance of a simplified, Llama-based TTS system. The key methodology involves using a single Transformer architecture with a vector quantizer (VQ) codec (X-codec2) and evaluating performance under varying model sizes, training data sizes, and inference-time search strategies (e.g., beam search, best-of-N). Primary results show that increasing training data from 80k to 250k hours improves the mean expert score on Chinese polyphonic characters from below 2.00 to around 2.25; scaling inference compute using a mixed strategy of PRM and ORM achieved higher SIM and kept WER near ground truth, on seed-tts-eval test-hard testset. For AI practitioners, this implies that both train-time and inference-time compute scaling are viable strategies for improving TTS quality, and that inference-time scaling can be a useful approach for balancing competing objectives like speaker similarity and content accuracy.  |

The main research question is whether integrating prompt content and format optimization can enhance LLM performance compared to content-only optimization methods. The key methodology involves iterative refinement using component-wise content optimization (case-diagnosis, Monte-Carlo sampling) and dynamic format exploration (LLM-assisted format generation, UCT-based selection). Primary results show that CFPO achieves an 8.6% absolute improvement in GSM8K accuracy using the LLaMA-3.1-8B model compared to the baseline prompt (50.03 to 63.38). For AI/ML engineers and data scientists, CFPO highlights that jointly optimizing both prompt content and format presents a practical approach to significantly boosting LLM performance and can be done using only open-source LLMs.  |

| Enhancing Code Generation for Low-Resource Languages: No Silver Bullet (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19085) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2501.19085))| gbavota, AML14, Devy1 | This paper investigates methods to improve code generation by Large Language Models (LLMs) for low-resource programming languages, finding no single superior technique across all contexts. The primary research question is: Which techniques are best suited to improve LLM-based code generation capabilities in low-resource programming languages? The study empirically evaluated in-context learning (translation examples, translation rules, few-shot) and fine-tuning (with/without pre-training on code translation) on six LLMs, using the MultiPL-E benchmark for R and Racket. Results show fine-tuning benefits smaller models (e.g., DeepSeek Coder 1B), increasing Racket pass@1 from 7.0% to 18.4% with pre-training & fine-tuning, while in-context learning, specifically with translation examples, generally improves performance for larger models and GitHub Copilot, with deltas over baseline reaching +6.3% in some test cases. AI practitioners should consider model size when boosting performance on low-resource languages, with in-context learning representing a generally effective and low-cost strategy, especially for larger LLMs.  |
| Weak-to-Strong Diffusion with Reflection (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00473) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.00473))| Zeke Xie, Masashi Sugiyama, Lichen Bai | The paper introduces Weak-to-Strong Diffusion (W2SD), a framework that enhances diffusion model inference by leveraging the difference between weak and strong models. The main research objective is to reduce the gap between the learned distribution of diffusion models and the real data distribution. The key methodology involves using a reflective operation that alternates between denoising and inversion, guided by the estimated difference between existing weak and strong models (weak-to-strong difference). Experiments demonstrate W2SD significantly improves human preference, with Juggernaut-XL and W2SD improving the HPSv2 winning rate up to 90% over the original results. AI practitioners can use W2SD as a general-purpose framework to improve the performance of diffusion models by defining appropriate weak-to-strong model pairs, leading to better alignment with real data distributions.  |
| Speak Easy: Eliciting Harmful Jailbreaks from LLMs with Simple Interactions (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04322) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.04322))| Marzyeh Ghassemi, Yik Siu Chan, YuxinXiao, narutatsuri | SPEAK EASY demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) can be jailbroken through simple, everyday human-LLM interactions to produce harmful content. The main research objective is to investigate whether harmful jailbroken responses, both actionable and informative, can be elicited from LLMs through common interaction patterns. The key methodology involves proposing HARMSCORE, a metric for evaluating jailbreak harmfulness, and SPEAK EASY, a framework using multi-step reasoning and multilingual querying to simulate realistic user interactions. Results show that incorporating SPEAK EASY into direct request and jailbreak baselines increased the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of GPT-4o by an average of 0.463 and HARMSCORE by 0.579 across four safety benchmarks. For AI practitioners, this implies that current safety alignment techniques in LLMs are vulnerable to simple, realistic interaction patterns, making careful consideration of such patterns in both red-teaming and defense necessary.  |

The main research question is how to design an optimal sampling scheme for generating response pairs in RLHF to improve sample efficiency and model performance. The key methodology is T-PILAF, a theoretically grounded sampling method generating responses by interpolating the policy and reference models, and its practical variant PILAF which implements this. Primary results show PILAF outperforms baselines in iterative and online Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) settings, achieving a final reward of -9.80 vs -10.16 for Vanilla sampling in the iterative setting, with a 40% reduction in training time. The principal implication is that AI practitioners can use PILAF to improve the efficiency and performance of RLHF by optimizing the data sampling process, resulting in higher rewards and lower divergence from the reference model.  |

The main research objective is to improve the physical plausibility and temporal consistency of generated videos, especially in contact-rich scenarios. The key methodology involves creating a 3D-aware video dataset (PointVid) by tracking 3D points in videos, fine-tuning a latent diffusion model on this dataset, and regularizing the generation process using 3D point information. Primary results show that, compared to I2VGen-XL, their method has background consistency score improvement of +0.061 on the VBench benchmark, along with other improvements such as better object permanence and more accurate hand-object interactions. For AI practitioners, this means adding a 3D spatial component to the video generation process creates better video quality.  |

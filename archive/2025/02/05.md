| Inverse Bridge Matching Distillation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01362) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.01362))| akorotin, dbaranchuk, apryc1, kekchpek, ngushchin | This paper introduces Inverse Bridge Matching Distillation (IBMD), a novel technique for accelerating the inference of diffusion bridge models (DBMs). The main research question is how to effectively distill both conditional and unconditional DBMs into fast, one-step or few-step generators while maintaining high generation quality. The key methodology is a distillation technique based on solving the inverse bridge matching problem using a tractable objective derived from the inverse formulation. The primary results show that IBMD can accelerate DBM inference by 4x to 100x, with a distilled one-step model achieving a FID score of 2.5 on a 4x super-resolution task, surpassing the teacher model's score of 2.8 obtained using 1000 steps. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that IBMD provides a universal and efficient method for distilling DBMs, enabling their practical application in various image-to-image translation tasks by significantly reducing inference time.  |
| VideoJAM: Joint Appearance-Motion Representations for Enhanced Motion Generation in Video Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02492) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.02492))| Adam Polyak, Yuval Kirstain, Amit Zohar, Uriel Singer, Hila | VideoJAM enhances motion coherence in video generation models by introducing a joint appearance-motion representation. The main research question is how to improve the temporal coherence of generated videos, which often lag behind visual fidelity in current models. The key methodology involves training a diffusion model to predict both pixel appearance and optical flow from a unified latent representation, coupled with an inference-time "Inner-Guidance" mechanism that leverages the model's own motion predictions to guide generation. Primary results show that VideoJAM outperforms state-of-the-art models on motion coherence, with human evaluators preferring VideoJAM's motion in 82.0% of cases against the DiT-4B baseline. Principal implication for AI practitioners is that incorporating an explicit motion prior through joint appearance-motion modeling can significantly enhance the temporal consistency of generated videos, directly improving the realism and applicability of video generation models.  |
| ACECODER: Acing Coder RL via Automated Test-Case Synthesis (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01718) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.01718))| Xiaotong Chen, Haozhe Wang, Huaye Zeng, pingnieuk, DongfuJiang | ACECODER automates test-case synthesis to train coder models via reinforcement learning (RL). The main research question is whether leveraging automated large-scale test-case synthesis can enhance code model training through RL. The key methodology involves generating extensive question-test-case pairs from existing code data, constructing preference pairs based on program pass rates, and training reward models using the Bradley-Terry loss, followed by RL. A primary result is that the Qwen2.5-Coder-7B model, after RL fine-tuning, achieved a 25% improvement on HumanEval-plus when starting from the base model directly. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that automated test-case synthesis provides a viable path to enhance code generation models using RL, offering a scalable method to improve model performance without reliance on extensive human-annotated datasets.  |
| QLASS: Boosting Language Agent Inference via Q-Guided Stepwise Search (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02584) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.02584))| Ziniu Hu, Da Yin, Xingcheng Yao, Yao Tang, Zongyu Lin | QLASS is a novel method for enhancing language agent inference through Q-guided stepwise search. The main research question is how to improve the performance of language agents on complex interactive tasks by providing effective intermediate guidance during inference. The key methodology involves automatically generating annotations by estimating Q-values in a stepwise manner, constructing an exploration tree, and performing process reward modeling to guide a Q-guided generation strategy. Primary results show that QLASS outperforms baselines on WebShop, SciWorld, and ALFWorld, achieving a 70.3% success rate on WebShop compared to 67.9% for the next best method, and demonstrates robust performance even with almost half the annotated data. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that QLASS provides a more effective way to perform inference-time search for language agents by leveraging Q-value-based process rewards, leading to improved decision-making in complex interactive tasks.  |
| Can LLMs Maintain Fundamental Abilities under KV Cache Compression? (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01941) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.01941))| Zeyu Li, Peijie Dong, Hong Chen, Zhenheng Tang, Dominic789654 | This paper investigates the impact of KV cache compression methods on large language model (LLM) capabilities.  The main research objective is to determine if LLMs retain fundamental abilities under various KV cache compression techniques.  A comprehensive empirical study across diverse tasks, employing prominent KV cache compression methods, was conducted.  Results showed arithmetic reasoning tasks were particularly sensitive to aggressive compression, with performance drops reaching 43.3%.  A key implication for AI practitioners is the task-specific sensitivity to compression, which necessitates careful consideration of task requirements when implementing these methods, particularly for tasks involving arithmetic reasoning.  |
| Satori: Reinforcement Learning with Chain-of-Action-Thought Enhances LLM Reasoning via Autoregressive Search (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02508) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.02508))| Zhenfang Chen, Zhang-Wei Hong, Zhenting Qi, Guangtao Zeng, maohaos2 | Satori is a 7B parameter large language model (LLM) that enhances reasoning capabilities via autoregressive search.  The research investigated whether a single LLM could internalize search capabilities to improve reasoning.  A two-stage training paradigm was employed, using chain-of-action-thought (COAT) reasoning and reinforcement learning with a “Restart and Explore” strategy.  Satori achieved state-of-the-art performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming the instruct model built on the same base model. The study's principal implication is that reinforcement learning can effectively enhance LLMs’ reasoning abilities, particularly through the introduction of meta-actions and self-improvement techniques, thus providing a more efficient pathway for developing advanced reasoning LLMs.  |
| Generating Multi-Image Synthetic Data for Text-to-Image Customization (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01720) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.01720))| Samaneh Azadi, Ishan Misra, Jun-Yan Zhu, Xi Yin, Nupur Kumari | This paper introduces a method for generating multi-image synthetic data to improve text-to-image model customization. The main research question is how to create a dataset and training method that enables tuning-free customization models to generate high-fidelity images of specific objects in diverse contexts. The key methodology involves generating a synthetic dataset (SynCD) using 3D assets and shared attention mechanisms, and training an encoder-based model with a novel inference technique that normalizes text and image guidance vectors. The primary results show that the proposed method outperforms existing tuning-free methods on standard customization benchmarks, achieving a geometric score of 0.838 with 3 input images compared to 0.780 for the next best method (JeDi). The principal implication for AI practitioners is that using synthetic data with multi-image supervision and shared attention mechanisms can significantly improve the performance of tuning-free text-to-image customization models.  |

| Soundwave: Less is More for Speech-Text Alignment in LLMs (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12900) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.12900))| Benyou, PhoenixAxis, FanBuCUHK, puccho, Yoohao | Soundwave utilizes an efficient training strategy and novel architecture to address representation space gap and sequence length inconsistency between speech and text in LLMs. The main research objective is to achieve data-efficient training for speech-text alignment in large language models. The key methodology is a two-stage training framework: Stage I aligns speech and text representations using an alignment adapter and CTC loss; Stage II reduces speech sequence length using a shrinking adapter. Soundwave outperforms Qwen2-Audio in speech translation and AIR-Bench speech tasks, using only one-fiftieth of the training data (10k hours vs. 520k hours). AI practitioners can achieve state-of-the-art speech understanding performance in LLMs with significantly reduced training data requirements by adopting Soundwave's two-stage alignment and shrinking approach.  |

The research objective is to develop a model that balances dual-modal prompts of text and image to achieve deep and simultaneous alignment of text and visual content in video generation. The key methodology involves redesigning a joint text-image injection model based on text-to-video and image-to-video architectures, and training it with text-image-video triplet data to learn cross-modal alignment. Primary results show Phantom leads in overall metrics for subject consistency with a score of 0.731 in CLIP-I-Seg and prompt following with the ViCLIP-T, demonstrating subject consistency competitive with commercial solutions. AI practitioners can use Phantom, which has a new architecture, for improved subject-consistent video generation, especially in tasks requiring ID preservation and consistency.  |
| Continuous Diffusion Model for Language Modeling (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11564) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.11564))| Sung Ju Hwang, harryjo97 | Riemannian Diffusion Language Model (RDLM) is a continuous diffusion framework for language modeling that incorporates the geometry of the statistical manifold. The main research objective is to establish a connection between discrete diffusion and continuous flow on the statistical manifold and design a continuous diffusion model for discrete data that generalizes previous discrete diffusion models. The key methodology involves reparameterizing discrete data to continuous states on a hypersphere, designing diffusion processes on the manifold that generalize discrete diffusion, and using a simulation-free training scheme based on radial symmetry. Primary results show that RDLM achieves a Bits Per Character (BPC) of â‰¤ 1.32 on the Text8 dataset, outperforming existing discrete diffusion models. The principal implication is that AI practitioners can leverage the geometry of the statistical manifold in continuous diffusion models to achieve improved performance in language modeling and other discrete data generation tasks, compared to existing discrete diffusion approaches.  |
| Cramming 1568 Tokens into a Single Vector and Back Again: Exploring the Limits of Embedding Space Capacity (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13063) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13063))| Aydar Bulatov, Mikhail Arkhipov, mbur, yurakuratov | This work explores the maximum information capacity of language model input embeddings by compressing text sequences into trainable vectors. The main research objective is to quantify how much text can be losslessly encoded into and decoded from a fixed-size vector representation within large language models (LLMs). The key methodology involves optimizing a set of prepended "memory" vectors to minimize the cross-entropy loss when reconstructing the original text using a frozen, pre-trained LLM. The primary result is that a single vector can enable a Llama-3.1-8B model to accurately reconstruct up to 1568 tokens, and this capacity scales nearly linearly with the number of trainable vectors (e.g. 16 vectors compress 7168 tokens). The principal implication for AI practioners is that LLM input embeddings have significantly more unused capacity than typically utilized, suggesting substantial room for improved context encoding and memory augmentation in model design.  |
| SafeRoute: Adaptive Model Selection for Efficient and Accurate Safety Guardrails in Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12464) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.12464))| Minki Kang, Dong Bok Lee, hbseong, dwgnr, Seanie-lee | SafeRoute adaptively selects between a smaller and larger safety guard model to improve the trade-off between computational cost and safety performance in LLM deployments. The paper's objective is to develop a method that distinguishes "hard" examples requiring a larger safety guard model from "easy" ones that a smaller model can handle. The core of the method is SafeRoute, a trained binary router that classifies input prompt-response pairs, selectively applying the larger model only when necessary. Results show SafeRoute improves the F1 score by 13% and 10% compared to always using the smaller or larger models on the WildGuardMix test split, while utilizing the larger model on only 5.09% of the data. AI practitioners can use SafeRoute to deploy safer LLMs more efficiently, reducing computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy in detecting harmful content.  |

The research question is: Can we infer multidimensional human preferences directly from large-scale binary comparisons? The method represents preferences as vectors, applies PCA to embedding differences between preferred and rejected responses, and identifies orthogonal basis vectors representing distinct preference aspects. DRMs using Gemma-2B-RM improved the single-head baseline accuracy from 0.733 to 0.814 on the RewardBench dataset. AI practitioners can use DRMs for more efficient test-time adaptation to diverse user preferences without requiring additional model training, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for personalized LLM alignment.  |

Primary results show that SOFAR achieves 48.7% accuracy on the Open6DOR benchmark and 74.9% accuracy on the SIMPLER benchmark for robotic manipulation. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that integrating semantic orientation into VLM systems provides a more flexible and accurate way to represent spatial knowledge, significantly improving performance in robotic manipulation tasks requiring precise object alignment and rearrangement.  |

The main research question is how to effectively distill knowledge from trained Transformer-based decoder-only MLLMs to create efficient, linear-complexity architectures without relying on pre-trained RNN-based LLMs or vision encoders. The key methodology involves a three-stage progressive distillation recipe and a seeding strategy to carve Mamba layers from trained Transformer layers, transferring knowledge while preserving multimodal capabilities. The primary results demonstrate that mmMamba-linear achieves competitive performance with existing linear and quadratic-complexity VLMs, achieving a 20.6x speedup and 75.8% GPU memory saving compared to HoVLE at 103K tokens. AI practitioners can leverage mmMamba to build more efficient and deployable multimodal models, particularly for long-context applications, by utilizing linear-complexity architectures with reduced computational demands.  |

The main research objective is to address the performance degradation of fine-tuned LLMs caused by minor variations in prompts. The key methodology is a two-stage approach: constructing a diverse set of candidate prompts and then dynamically sampling from these prompts during fine-tuning. Primary results show that PAFT achieves 87.57% average accuracy on the RACE-high dataset, significantly outperforming baseline models and reducing variance across different prompts. PAFT's dynamic sampling during fine-tuning helps models generalize better to unseen prompts, maintaining high performance and improving inference efficiency for AI practitioners using fine-tuned models.  |

Primary results show that MUDDPythia-2.8B matches Pythia-6.9B in pre-training perplexity and downstream tasks, while adding only 0.23% parameters and 0.4% computation. For AI practitioners, MUDDFormer offers a method to significantly improve Transformer performance and scalability, especially with deeper models, with minimal parameter and computational overhead.  |
| Revisiting the Test-Time Scaling of o1-like Models: Do they Truly Possess Test-Time Scaling Capabilities? (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12215) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.12215))| Yunhua Zhou, Qinyuan Cheng, Zhiyuan Zeng, xpqiu, yinzhangyue | This paper investigates whether o1-like models (QwQ, R1, and LIMO) truly possess test-time scaling capabilities. The main research question is whether increasing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) length in these models consistently improves reasoning performance. The researchers systematically investigated the relationship between CoT length and accuracy, and prompted models for self-revisions, comparing sequential and parallel scaling strategies. A primary result is that longer CoTs did not consistently improve accuracy; correct solutions were often shorter, and R1-Distill-32b and R1-Distill-14b maintained the original wrong answer in over 70% of cases when prompted to revise. The principal implication is that AI practitioners should consider parallel scaling and methods like "Shortest Majority Vote" for these models, as sequential scaling via self-revision is not consistently effective due to limited self-revision capabilities.  |

The main research objective is to develop a framework that enables LLMs to effectively tackle complex reasoning tasks across diverse domains without requiring additional training or fine-tuning.  Key methodology involves using standardized tool cards to encapsulate tool functionality, a planner for high-level and low-level task planning, and an executor to carry out tool usage based on generated commands.  Primary results show that OctoTools achieves an average accuracy gain of 9.3% over zero-shot GPT-4o and outperforms other agent frameworks like AutoGen, GPT-Functions, and LangChain by up to 10.6% when given the same set of tools.

The main research objective is to address the issue of accumulated historical information in existing test-time scaling methods, which wastes computational resources and interferes with effective reasoning. The key methodology is a two-phase state transition mechanism: (1) decomposing the current question into a dependency-based directed acyclic graph, and (2) contracting subquestions into a new independent question, iteratively until directly solvable. Primary results show that on HotpotQA, AOT applied to gpt-4o-mini achieves an 80.6% F1 score. The principal implication for AI practitioners is that AOT can be used as a standalone framework or a plug-in enhancement to improve LLMs' reasoning capabilities, by reducing unnecessary historical information to enhance efficiency.  |
| FinMTEB: Finance Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10990) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.10990))| Yi Yang, yixuantt | FinMTEB is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating text embedding models in the financial domain.

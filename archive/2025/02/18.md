The main research objective is to develop a controller that enables humanoid robots to autonomously recover from falls in real-world settings. The key methodology is a two-stage reinforcement learning approach with a curriculum, where Stage I discovers a getting-up trajectory and Stage II refines it into a deployable, robust policy via imitation learning and control regularization. The primary results show that the learned policy enables a Unitree G1 robot to get up from supine poses with a 78.3% success rate on varied terrains, outperforming the robot's built-in controller. The principal implication is that this framework provides AI practitioners a method to train robust fall recovery policies for humanoid robots, enhancing their real-world deployability by making robots more resilient.  |

The main research questions are whether LLMs truly lose reasoning capabilities under constrained decoding and how to reduce syntax errors while preserving unconstrained reasoning. The key methodology is a reasoning-augmented constrained decoding algorithm (CRANE) that alternates between unconstrained generation for reasoning and constrained generation for structurally correct outputs, supported by theoretical analysis of LLM expressivity. CRANE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art constrained decoding strategies and unconstrained decoding, showing up to a 10% accuracy improvement on the GSM-symbolic and FOLIO benchmarks.

| Better Embeddings with Coupled Adam (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08441) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.08441))| Tobias Stollenwerk, flxst | The paper introduces Coupled Adam, a modification of the Adam optimizer, to address the anisotropy problem in language model embeddings. The main research question is whether the second moment in the Adam optimizer contributes to anisotropic word embeddings in language models and how this can be mitigated. The key methodology involves analyzing the embedding update vectors under SGD and Adam, proposing a modified Adam optimizer ("Coupled Adam") that averages the second moment across vocabulary items, and empirically evaluating its impact on embedding quality and model performance. Primary results show Coupled Adam improves embedding isotropy significantly, achieving values above 0.90 in most small-scale experiments, and enhances upstream/downstream performance on sufficiently large datasets. For AI practitioners, using Coupled Adam instead of standard Adam can improve the quality of word embeddings and boost model performance, particularly for large language models.  |
| Towards Data-Efficient Pretraining for Atomic Property Prediction (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11085) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.11085))| Bernard Ghanem, Yasir Ghunaim, hammh0a | This paper investigates data-efficient pretraining for atomic property prediction, showing that strategic dataset selection can match or surpass large-scale pretraining with significantly reduced computational cost. The main research objective is to determine if pretraining on a smaller, task-relevant dataset can achieve comparable or superior performance to large-scale pretraining in atomic property prediction. The key methodology introduces the Chemical Similarity Index (CSI), a metric inspired by Fréchet Inception Distance, to quantify the alignment between upstream pretraining datasets and downstream tasks, and uses this to select pretraining data. A primary result is that models pretrained on the ANI-1x dataset (using the CSI for selection) achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 5.4 on rMD17, outperforming JMP-S (MAE of 6.7) with 24 times less computational budget. Principal implication for AI practitioners is that strategic selection of pretraining data based on task relevance, assessed using metrics like CSI, can achieve competitive performance with significantly reduced computational resources in atomic property prediction, favoring quality over quantity.  |

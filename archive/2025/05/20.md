Rabiee, Zahra Dehghanian, Mahta Fetrat Qharabagh | i) This paper addresses homograph disambiguation in grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, particularly for low-resource languages like Persian. ii) The research aims to improve homograph disambiguation accuracy in both neural and rule-based G2P systems, while maintaining low latency for real-time applications. iii) A semi-automated pipeline for constructing a homograph-focused dataset (HomoRich) was developed, along with a lightweight statistical method to enhance G2P systems. iv) Fine-tuning a state-of-the-art neural G2P model (GE2PE) on HomoRich achieved a 29.72% improvement in homograph accuracy, and integrating the statistical method into eSpeak resulted in a 30.66% improvement in homograph disambiguation. v) The HomoRich dataset and the statistical disambiguation method provide AI practitioners with resources to enhance the accuracy of both neural and rule-based G2P systems, particularly in low-resource scenarios where real-time performance is critical for applications like screen readers.  |
| LLM Context Conditioning and PWP Prompting for Multimodal Validation of
  Chemical Formulas (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12257) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.12257))| PChemGuy | LLM Context Conditioning and PWP Prompting for Multimodal Validation of Chemical Formulas investigates methods for improving Large Language Model (LLM) accuracy in identifying errors within scientific documents, specifically chemical formulas. The main objective is to enhance the reliability of general-purpose LLMs for precise validation tasks, focusing on chemical formulas validation within a test paper containing known errors. Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP) principles informed structured LLM context conditioning was used to modulate LLM behavior at inference time via chat interfaces of Gemini 2.5 Pro and ChatGPT Plus 03. PWP-informed context conditioning improved textual error identification with both models, and Gemini 2.5 Pro repeatedly identified a subtle image-based formula error previously overlooked. This study implies that PWP-informed context conditioning can enhance LLM-driven analytical workflows, particularly for tasks requiring meticulous error detection in scientific and technical documents.  |

| AI-Driven Scholarly Peer Review via Persistent Workflow Prompting,
  Meta-Prompting, and Meta-Reasoning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03332) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.03332))| PChemGuy | This paper explores AI-driven scholarly peer review using large language models (LLMs). The research question focuses on developing a persistent workflow prompting (PWP) methodology for critical analysis by LLMs, especially for experimental chemistry manuscripts. The key methodology involves creating a hierarchical, modular prompt architecture (structured via Markdown) and iteratively refining the prompt through meta-prompting and meta-reasoning. The primary result demonstrates the LLM's ability to identify major methodological flaws, distinguishing claims from evidence, and performing quantitative feasibility checks on a test case. The principal implication for AI practitioners lies in the potential of PWP to enable sophisticated analysis of complex scientific tasks using readily available LLMs, reducing the need for custom-tailored models or extensive training data.  |

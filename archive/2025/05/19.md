| Learning Dense Hand Contact Estimation from Imbalanced Data (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11152) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.11152))| kyoungmu, dqj5182 | Learning dense hand contact estimation is addressed by mitigating class and spatial imbalance in hand interaction datasets.
